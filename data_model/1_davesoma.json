Friendship with the eminent dead Marcus Aurelius \u201cThat sounds funny, making friends among the eminent dead, but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better in life and work better in education.\u201d Charlie Munger In the latest article, I resurrected Marcus Aurelius through openAI GPT and posed questions to him in order to provide readers with a broader spectrum and draw parallels between the challenges and doubts we face today and those encountered by Marcus in his time. In my opinion, we are currently too narrowly focused on influencers and authors who are, unfortunately, often biased by societal expectations. An interview with a champion from the past helps to expand our perspective and regain the competitive advantage that has been lost over time. Email Address Today, I will focus primarily on what Marcus has to say during an interview between myself and the great Emperor, similar to the approach I took with my interview with Lee Kuan Yew, which I highly recommend you check out. Here, I will provide a brief description of who Marcus Aurelius was. Marcus Aurelius (121-180 AD) was a Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher, reigning from 161 to 180 AD. He is best known for his personal philosophical writings, collectively called the \u201cMeditations,\u201d which consist of a series of reflections on Stoic philosophy, personal ethics, and the human condition. As emperor, Marcus Aurelius was known for his wisdom, fairness, and commitment to the well-being of his people. His reign is considered the final period of the Pax Romana, a time of relative peace and stability throughout the Roman Empire. Today, Marcus Aurelius is remembered as one of the \u201cFive Good Emperors\u201d of Rome and as a prominent figure in the history of Stoicism. Stoicism is an ancient Greek and Roman philosophy founded in the 3rd century BC by Zeno of Citium. It teaches that the key to a virtuous and",

I found many of Marcus Aurelius\u2019s suggestions, and those of ancient Stoics more broadly, to be both educational and enriching for my personal growth. They have not only helped me build resilience in life but also in investing (as discussed in The Mind article). I have actively endeavored to incorporate Stoicism, along with principles and values from various religions and philosophies, into my life in order to maintain a balanced perspective on my experiences and the challenges I face in both life and investing.For this reason, I am passionate about helping my readers embrace a similar approach. Here is a brief overview of my project, and within this article, you will find a more comprehensive exploration of my ideas. #web3 #AI #MarcusAurelius #NFTIntroducing DSAssistant \u2013 my NFTs now provide the chance to interact with eminent dead from history.

Marcus what skills do I need to acquire to be sovereign? To be sovereign, you must acquire the skills of self-discipline, self-awareness, and self-control.Self-discipline is the ability to focus on a task and complete it without being distracted. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and how they affect others.Self-control is the ability to resist temptation and make decisions that are in line with your values and goals. All of these skills are essential for a sovereign life. In a world full of illusions and distractions, how can I learn to improve my focus? As Marcus Aurelius, I would advise you to practice mindfulness and focus on",

        "text": "As Marcus Aurelius, I would advise you to practice mindfulness and focus on the present moment.Start by taking a few moments each day to sit in silence and observe your thoughts and feelings without judgement.Notice how your body feels and the sensations that arise.This will help you to become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, and to recognize when your mind is wandering. As you practice this, you will become better at staying focused and present in the moment. What is your opinion on a currency that is intentionally devalued over time? I would caution against a currency which is debased over time. Such a practice can lead to economic instability and can have a negative impact on the people who rely on the currency. It is important to maintain the value of a currency in order to ensure that it remains a reliable form of exchange. What is the essential component of a stable financial system and society? The essential component of a stable financial system and society is trust. Trust in the institutions that govern our financial system, trust in the people who manage it, and trust in the laws and regulations that protect it. Without trust, our financial system and society would be vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation. Therefore, it is important to cultivate an environment of trust and integrity in order to ensure a stable financial system and society. The coin of the empire is debased by evil emperors, there is an alternative which cannot be debased and its ledger is public, what citizens should do? As citizens of the Roman Empire, it is important to be aware of the potential for evil emperors to debase the coin of the empire. To protect ourselves from this, we should seek out alternative forms of currency that cannot be debased and whose ledgers are public. This will ensure that our wealth is secure and that we are not taken advantage of by those in power. We should also be mindful of our own behavior and strive to be honest and honorable in all our dealings. By doing so, we can ensure that our wealth is not taken away from us by those who would seek to do us harm. What are five practical suggestions to become successful in life? 1. Cultivate a sense of",

Indeed, I believe I am equipped to do so, having experienced years of personal suffering, as well as witnessing my mother and many of her friends struggle with depression and other mental illnesses. I saw firsthand my mother\u2019s pain, society\u2019s insensitivity, and the limitations of my own mind in handling the situation.I soon recognized that knowledge was the armor I sought, and I will devote my entire life to perfecting this armor for my own protection and to defend the truth against its adversaries. This article will be composed in collaboration with a digital incarnation of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, brought back to life to provide the insights of an emperor and philosopher. As the last of the great emperors, his passing left Rome to its ill-fated destiny. Email Address As I envision a futuristic version of Marcus, I picture an open-minded leader who embraces every available technology to improve himself as a human being, avoiding the pitfalls of illusions and cheap dopamine. He utilizes technology as an instrument to liberate himself and pave the way for human advancement.I imagine Marcus in the midst of a battle campaign, as he was accustomed to participating in and where he ultimately met his end, alongside others who were aligned with him.I also envision Marcus in a Virtual Reality environment, addressing an audience and explaining that the current battle is not fought solely with physical weapons and armor, but is a struggle to preserve our humanity, defend our creativity, and combat the allure of numerous distractions and illusions. It is a battle to pursue the freedom of our minds and safeguard them from unwanted conquerors. He recognized that technology is a tool to",

We must strive to be mentally strong, to stay focused on our goals, and to never give up. We must be resilient in the face of adversity and never forget that our strength comes from within. With a strong mind, we can achieve anything.

To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action\u2026To remain alive, he must think.\u201d Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged The mind is extremely important because it constitutes our identity. It can be an incredible and powerful resource or a torturous prison, depending on how it is utilized. The mind is a scarce resource that many people seek to control, as evidenced by the abundance of content and media that inundates our lives from birth. This battle for mindshare is illustrated in an article about Mindshare, which, though unrelated to the topic at hand, shows how interconnected various disciplines can be when profit is the driving force to capture someone\u2019s attention.A prime example is how Coca-Cola has shaped our perception of Christmas. We are constantly exposed to TV series, news, journalism, music, advertisements, and political debates.

Why do we mindlessly consume unhealthy and frightening content? Is it because we care about the suffering of other humans? In most cases, the answer is no. We often don\u2019t care, and even if we did, we are usually not in a position to do anything about it. The reality is that much of the content we consume is propaganda designed to drive a specific narrative. As a result, we are less able and less willing to act, leaving us to wonder why we continue to torture ourselves with this information. We are often unwittingly complicit in major crimes perpetrated by our representatives, as highlighted in the Bitcoin Magazine article about Bitcoin as a currency of decolonization. What I\u2019m trying to convey is eloquently expressed by Balaji Srinivasan in his book, \u201cThe Network State.\u201d A War for Minds, Not Lands It\u2019s a mistake to think a Second American Civil War would look anything like the first Civil War, or like World War 2 for that matter. It\u2019d be nothing like the movies with huge movements of uniformed soldiers, tanks, and planes. Instead it\u2019ll just be a continuation and escalation of what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years: a network-to-network war to control minds, rather than state-to-state war to control territory.

Fig. 3 Brain Hardware and Software We can separate the mind into two distinct components: There is a physical and a metaphysical aspect, much like a computer, which has hardware and software. Brain structures and psychological structures are both essential for the proper functioning of this device. My objective is not to delve into every existing theory about psychology, but rather to highlight the main principles I find valid in my life and provide the reader with some software to enhance their brain performance. Let\u2019s begin by discussing the physical component of the mind.It\u2019s crucial to note that both the physical and psychological aspects are vulnerable to traumatic events that can permanently impair their functionality. Therefore, it\u2019s important to exercise caution. \u201cGreater exposure to repetitive head trauma is associated with lower brain volumes and lower processing speed in active professional fighters.\u201d ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Same problem with alcohol consumption: \u201cAn analysis of data from more than 36,000 adults, led by a team from the University of Pennsylvania, found that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption was associated with reductions in overall brain volume.

However, I would be cautious about reducing humans to just their ability to mentally rotate shapes. What I am certain of is that, regardless of your starting point, your brain, like your body, is influenced by the fuel you put into it. Perhaps you are not destined to be an athlete, but if you start eating well, you may surpass athletes who lack discipline and nutritional knowledge.

I already delved into the physical aspect in my previous chapter, which I suggest you read if you haven\u2019t already done so.

Our metaphysical brain is the subject of many battles, such as those involving religion. What is religion, if not an attempt to capture the minds of as many people as possible?

One of the competitive advantages of the Homo species is precisely our ability to coordinate beyond our physical boundaries and tribes. This is possible because we can be unified by myths, which are mimetic devices capable of infecting our brains and reproducing themselves from one brain to another like a virus, creating a larger tribe with shared rules.There\u2019s no need for the leader to be present or even alive.

One of my favorite topics, often misunderstood yet incredibly important, is dopamine. If you can master your dopamine, you can master your mind. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in motivation, reward, and pleasure-seeking behaviors.If you control the carrots, you can decide where your horse goes and at what speed. It is tied to motivation and energy.Do you remember Marcus Aurelius?The most famous statue in his honor is the equestrian statue, where Marcus rides a horse he masters. However, if someone else controls your dopamine reward system, you become a slave, and they decide where your horse goes. There are many external variables that affect our minds, with various drugs (like cocaine), cigarettes, and social media all having an impact on our dopamine systems. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard for me to imagine that in 20 years from now we find that what social media does to our brains is equivalent to what smoking does to our lungs\u201d.

Porn Frankly, it has been proven in many ways that porn creates addiction, and above all, it affects the dopamine system. It depletes our resources in various ways. The overabundance of sex, which in nature is as scarce as food, has a terrible effect on our motivation, which arises from scarcity rather than abundance. There\u2019s nothing wrong with liking sex, but you need to maintain a balance. Madness For many reasons I explained before, the truth is hidden behind a smoke curtain. Numerous illusions stand between us and reality, and the pursuit of reality is an infinite challenge for us as humans. However, this is not a reason to stop seeking the truth and striving to improve ourselves in order to see beyond this fog. Nowadays, we have the tools to be better than the alcoholic Vikings. When you start dissolving these illusions, you may feel as if you are going mad. That\u2019s because we define normality based on our peers.

Emotions. I delved into the topics of dopamine, serotonin, and sugar, and I strive to avoid anything that behaves in spikes. When something is overly emotional or promotional, I avoid it. I mean, in an unnatural way, like when the food industry tends to add too much sugar to their food products, making them unnatural and addictive. The same occurs with emotions and instincts, which are unfortunately weaponized by marketers and social media agents. LIVE THE PRESENT This was my main problem: I kept reading Buddhist or Stoic suggestions and quotes that advised living in the present, but what did that mean and how could I do it? I can speak for myself; for me, those statements didn\u2019t help. It was only after I started resolving this question within myself that I began to understand what those quotes meant.My biggest mistake was thinking that I could force myself to apply some wise quotes and the problem would be solved. In reality, at least for me, it doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s not like learning how to code a smart contract; it\u2019s more like installing software that gradually guides your consciousness on the right path, and only after that do those quotes start making sense. \u201cIf you are depressed you are living in the past.

Well, I started opening my mind and doing things that didn\u2019t make sense to me at the time, but now those things make total sense. I\u2019m talking about meditation.Despite the fact that I sympathize with many transhumanist approaches linked to the implementation of technology in our lives, I want to start by emphasizing again that you don\u2019t need to pay someone, subscribe to an app, or use a device. Meditation is about your own mind; there are no shortcuts. Once, I read an interesting description of meditation: \u201cMeditation is like unloading your email from the mailbox.\u201d Indeed, that\u2019s the impression it gives, as if you feel lighter. It\u2019s just you and your own mind. \u201cSince everything which exists or happens for a man exists only in his consciousness and happens for it alone, the most essential thing for a man is the constitution of this consciousness, which is in most cases far more important than the circumstances which go to form its contents.\u201d \u201cand if we don\u2019t have control over those two things [birth and death], we probably don\u2019t have much control over what happens in between. What we do have control over is our capacity to be aware [awareness?].\u201d A. Schopenhauer Fig. 9 Meditation My first experience with meditation could be described as the most terrible 5 minutes of my life. I felt like I was wearing a straightjacket, and the more time passed, the more restless I became. I think everyone experiences something like that for the first few weeks, and it suggests an unhealthy condition.There are those pictures of relaxing meditation moments in the middle of a field of flowers, but the reality is that my first attempt was incredibly boring, and I just wanted the torture to end. I had the same feeling for many years during my first approach to weightlifting and running.Over time, meditation became a moment to allow my thoughts to flow and be",

I could then observe them and let them show themselves, like the system of planets shown in the picture. A system of thoughts where everyone has specific dimensions and gravitational forces. I sit in a comfortable position with an upright back, without stimuli or distractions. I don\u2019t even anchor my thinking to any specific variable; I just sit down and wait.It\u2019s like training your mind to be disciplined and calm. My feeling is that it takes time to appreciate meditation, mostly because you need a calm mind to allow your thoughts to express themselves without distractions. Fig. 10 Engineer your brain Meditation has a positive side effect, which is the realization of the thoughts inside our brain and what causes them. In other words, I started questioning myself about the kind of content I consume and who filters this content for me.I quickly realized the importance of personally taking charge of this role, becoming the curator not just of my body\u2019s nutrient intake but also of my mind\u2019s nutrient intake. The flow of information your mind consumes defines the shape and health of your perceptions. Knowledge installs models which, like the lens of a camera, define what you see and how you see it. Be skeptical about your perception and shape them based on facts and track records.Meditation is like your car lift, the mechanical workshop where you can check how your brain works. To improve and control the information my brain absorbs, I developed the concept of a cultural supplement described in the article (AI consciousness), a knowledge supplement pill, where I use the wisest content and exploit the latest Large Language Model to distill wisdom from them. That\u2019s because I realized that everything has already been said, and the voices of the past are less affected by modern propaganda.

For example, currently in human history, glycolysis (using glucose as the primary metabolic pathway) is considered the norm for nutrition. What if this is entirely incorrect?

However, friends are more intimate, so it\u2019s important to choose them carefully because, as a friend of mine once pointed out, \u201cfriends require maintenance.\u201d This implies that a true friend takes resources, much like an investment. If you want to outperform the average, you need a few good assets and must watch them carefully. Thanks to powerful communication tools, we can exponentially improve our social circles.

Rather than openly contradicting others, seek to facilitate means of evaluation and critical thinking practice as a group activity.

        "text": "things. We are primed for survival, and our aversion to pain can distort our judgment for a modern world. Pro-and-con lists, as well as thinking in terms of probabilities, can help you evaluate things more objectively than relying on a cognitive impression. Optimism Bias you overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes. There can be benefits to a positive attitude, but it\u2019s unwise to allow such an attitude to adversely affect our ability to make rational judgments(they\u2019re not mutually exclusive). If you make rational, realistic judgments you\u2019ll have a lot more to feel positive about. Pessimism bias You overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes. Pessimism is often a defense mechanism against disappointment, or it can be the result of depression and anxiety disorders. Perhaps the worst aspect of pessimism is that even if something good happens, you\u2019ll probably feel pessimistic about it anyway. Reactance You\u2019d rather do the opposite of what someone is trying to make you do. When we feel our liberty is being constrained, our inclination is to resist, however in doing so we can overcompensate. Be careful not to lose objectivity when someone is being coercive/manipulative, or trying to force you to do something. Wisdom springs from reflection, folly from reaction. Spotlight effect You overestimate how much people notice how you look and act. Most people are much more concerned about themselves than they are about you. Absent over prejudices, people generally want to like and get along with you as it gives them validation too. Instead of worrying about how you\u2019re being judged, consider how you make others feel. They\u2019ll remember this much more, and you\u2019ll make the world a better place.

Keep a healthy body and bank balance by using evidence-based medicine from a qualified doctor. Bystander effect You presume someone else is going to do something in an emergency situation.When something terrible is happening in a public setting we can experience a kind of shock and mental paralysis that distracts us from a sense of personal responsibility. The problem is that everyone can experience this sense of deindividuation in a crowd. if there\u2019s an emergency situation, presume to be one who will help or call for help. Be the change you want to see in the world. Availability heuristic Your judgments are influenced by what springs most easily to mind. How recent, emotionally powerful, or unusual your memories are can make them seem more relevant. This, in turn, can cause you to apply them too readily. Try to gain different perspectives and relevant statistical information rather than relying purely on first judgements and emotive influences. Curse of Knowledge Things make sense once they make sense, so it can be hard to remember why they didn\u2019t. We build complex networks of understanding and forget how intricate the path to our available knowledge really is. When teaching someone something new, go slow and explain like they\u2019re ten years old (without being patronizing). Repeat key points and facilitate active practice to help embed knowledge. Belief Bias If a conclusion supports your existing beliefs, you\u2019ll rationalize anything that supports it. It\u2019s difficult for us to set aside our existing beliefs to consider the true merits of an argument. In practice this means that our ideas become impervious to criticism, and are perpetually reinforced. A useful thing to ask is \u201cwhen and how did I get this belief?\u201d We tend to automatically defend our ideas without ever really questioning them.

It\u2019s easy to tell ourselves that we deserve these things, while blaming circumstances when things don\u2019t go our way. When judging others, be mindful of how this bias interacts with the just-world hypothesis, fundamental attribution error, and the in-group bias. Declinism You remember the past as better than it was, and expect the future to be worse than it will likely be. Despite living in the most peaceful and prosperous time in history, many people believe things are getting worse. The 24 hour new cycle, with its reporting of overtly negative and violent events, may account for some of this effect. Instead of relying on nostalgic im\u00e8pression of how great things used to be, use measurable metrics such as life expectancy, levels of crime and violence, and prosperity statistics. Framing effect You allow yourself to be unduly influenced by context and delivery. We all like to think that we think independently,but the truth is that all of us are, in fact, influenced by delivery, framing, and subtle cues. This is why the ad industry is a thing, despite almost everyone believing they\u2019re not affected by advertising messages. Only when we have the intellectual humility to accept the fact that we can be manipulated, can we hope to limit how much we are. Try to be mindful of how things are being put to you. Just world hypothesis Your preference for a just world makes you presume that it exists. A world in which people don\u2019t alway get what they deserve, hard work doesn\u2019t always pay off, and injustice happens is an uncomfortable one that threatens our preferred narrative. However, it is also the reality. A more just world requires understanding rather than blame.

Try to imagine yourself in the position of those in out-groups; whilst also attempting to be dispassionate when judging those who belong to your in-groups. Fundamental attribution error You judge others on their character, but yourself on the situation. If you haven\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep, you know why you\u2019re being a bit slow, but if you observe someone else being slow you don\u2019t have such knowledge and so might presume them to just be a slow person. It\u2019s not only kind to view others\u2019 situations with charity, it\u2019s more objective too. Be mindful to also err on the side of taking personal responsibility rather than justifying and blaming. Halo Effect How much you like someone, or how attractive they are, influences your other judgments of them. Our judgments are associative and automatic, and so if we want to be objective we need to consciously control for irrelevant influences. This is especially important in a professional setting. If you notice that you\u2019re giving consistently high or low marks across the board, it\u2019s worth considering that your judgment may be suffering from the halo effect. Anchoring The first thing you judge influences your judgment of all that follows. Human minds are associative in nature, so the order in which we receive information helps determine the course of our judgments and perceptions. Be especially mindful of this bias during financial negotiations such as houses, cars, and salaries. The initial price offered is proven to have a significant effect. Sunk cost fallacy You irrationally cling to things that have already cost you something. When we\u2019ve invested our time, money, or emotion into something, it hurts us to let it go. This aversion to pain can distort our better judgment and cause us to make unwise investments. To regain objectivity, ask yourself: had I not already invested something, would I still do so",

Confirmation bias You look for ways to justify your existing beliefs. We are primed to see and agree with ideas that fit our preconceptions, and to ignore and dismiss information that conflicts with them. Think of your ideas and beliefs as software you\u2019re actively trying to find problems with rather than things to be defended. \u201cThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself \u2013 and you are the easiest person to fool.\u201d Richard Feynman Dunning-Kruger effect The more you know, the less confident you\u2019re likely to be. Because experts know just how much they don\u2019t know, they tend to underestimate their ability; but it\u2019s easy to be over-confident when you have only a simple idea of how things are. \u201cThe whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are so certain of themselves, yet wiser people are so full of doubts.\u201d Bertrand Russell Backfire effect When your core beliefs are challenged, it can cause you to believe even more strongly. We can experience being wrong about some ideas as an attack upon our very selves, or our tribal identity This can lead to motivated reasoning which causes us to double-down, despite disconfirming evidence. \u201cit ain\u2019t what you don\u2019t know that gets you into trouble. it\u2019s what you know for sure that just ain\u2019t so.\u201d Mark Twain Barnum effect You see personal specifics in vague statements by filling in the gaps. Because our minds are given to making connections, it\u2019s easy for us to take nebulous statements and find ways to interpret them so that they seem specific and personal. Psychics, astrologers and others use this bias to make it seem like they\u2019re telling you something relevant. Consider how things might be interpreted to apply to anyone, not just you.

For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility; and I affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest\u201d Marcus Aurelius DISCLAIMER: THIS WEBSITE DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE Feel free to comment, share my article with friends and subscribe to my newsletter if you like my content and you want to follow me towards financial freedom.

I think the principles of life are few and it could be a good idea to distill them from the writings of people who make history for the better. I will probably try this experiment with many other individuals and maybe even try to mix them together in a single huge database, trying to extract useful lessons and principles from cross-referencing content, such as the corpus of TNS cohort articles. But, for now, let\u2019s start with Singapore\u2019s founding father \u201cIt\u2019s no accident that Singapore has a much better record, given where it started, than the United States. There, power was concentrated in one enormously talented person, Lee Kuan Yew.\u201d Charlie Munger Lee Kuan Yew (1923-2015) was a Singaporean politician and statesman who served as the first Prime Minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990. He played a key role in the transformation of Singapore from a British colony into a prosperous, modern city-state. Lee Kuan Yew was born in Singapore and studied law at Cambridge University in England. In 1954, he founded the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) and began campaigning for self-government for Singapore. In 1959, the PAP won the general election and Lee became the first Prime Minister of Singapore, leading the country to independence from Malaysia in 1965. As Prime Minister, Lee implemented policies that emphasized economic growth, social order, and racial harmony. He established a meritocratic system of government, which valued education and talent, and promoted Singapore as a centre for trade and finance. Under Lee\u2019s leadership, Singapore became one of the most prosperous and successful countries in Asia, with a high standard of living, a strong",

However, his policies also drew criticism for their authoritarianism and restrictions on civil liberties. After stepping down as Prime Minister in 1990, Lee remained active in politics and continued to influence Singaporean society until his death in 2015. He is widely regarded as a founding father of modern Singapore and a respected statesman and leader in the region. Lee Kuan Yew achieved a remarkable level of success in Singapore, as evidenced by the country\u2019s per capita income growth over two generations. In the early days of his leadership, per capita income was around $400, but through his policies and programs, Singapore\u2019s economy grew significantly, and now, after only a few decades, per capita income has risen to over $50,000, demonstrating the magnitude of the economic transformation that took place under his leadership. \u201cWhat would Lee Kuan Yew do? What would David Ben-Gurion do? What would George Washington do? What would the people you respect advise in your situation? A language model trained on their corpora \u2014 on all the public text and audio they\u2019ve emitted over their lives, which could amount to many millions of words \u2014 may achieve something like the sci-fi episode where people are revived by AI in an app.\u201d The Network State, Balji Srinivasan I have decided to bring Lee Kuan Yew to life and ask him some questions on how to build a strong and competitive community.

These points are helpful not only for those who engineer society, but also for the citizens who inhabit it. Fig. 2 Optimalist Lee Kuan Yew available on Opensea.io.

Cohesion and alignment within a community can be achieved by creating a shared set of values and goals that everyone can strive towards. This could include emphasizing the importance of hard work, excellence and productivity, as well as the importance of providing a better future for the next generation. Additionally, it is important to create a sense of belonging and connection within the community, so that everyone feels like they are part of something larger than themselves. This could be done through activities such as community service, shared meals, or other activities that bring people together. Define the risks of managing a community and how mitigate them: The risks of managing a community include the potential for conflict between members, the potential for members to become disengaged or uninterested, and the potential for members to become overwhelmed by the amount of work or responsibility. To mitigate these risks, it is important to ensure that the community is well-structured and organized, that members are given clear roles and responsibilities, and that there is a system in place to address any conflicts that arise. Additionally, it is important to provide members with resources and support to help them stay engaged and motivated, and to ensure that the workload is manageable. What are the qualities of a good citizen A good citizen is someone who is productive, strives for excellence, and is motivated to make a positive impact on their community. They should be willing to work hard to improve their own life and the lives of those around them. They should also be respectful of the law and customs of their community, and be willing to help others in need. Finally, they should be committed to making the world a better place for everyone.

I am writing this piece during my lunch break. Usually, I use this time to weightlift in my home gym and, in the meantime, I like to read or write, as is the case today. I must confess that this is the least interesting write-up for me. I have trained myself for more than 15 years, and I would prefer to get straight to the point of my last article, which is the mind: the ultimate land to conquer in the battle for sovereignty. I am looking forward to it. As I explained in the first article (Optimalism, Starts with Diet and Discipline), I started my journey because of many troubles I had in my life when I was young, and I felt like some more physical strength was the solution. In some ways, it was, but as usual, life takes some weird paths, and what I realized is that the body is a means to arrive at the mind. The deep meaning you can reach by exploring your own mind is well beyond any kind of travel you can do on the other side of the planet. Indeed, any journey, if well-experienced, is actually a journey into your mind in order to reach wisdom. But I can\u2019t even reach those conclusions if not through my body and the improvement of myself, because at the end of the day, our brain is on top of our body and there are many connections between them. If your mind is a temple, the body is the walls of this temple, and in some ways, the foundation. It is the machine that helps you get the best from your living experience. The body isn\u2019t just a bastion but also a teacher. The body teaches us the importance of strength, discipline, and perseverance. As a teacher, the body shows you the importance of long-term commitment and the never-ending journey of improving oneself, which are omnipresent digressions during my three-chapter analysis.

Firstly, because you are a physical entity, and you evolve in a physical environment with physical laws that are usually issued to challenge you! Yes, the meaning of our life is to be challenged and to prove that we are elements worth living. What do I mean? I mean that you are what you are going to communicate through your habits. If you tell your body that you have already accomplished the most important life goal and become lazy, your body will start to succumb to entropy. We are animals, and in a comfortable context, we become lazy because nature doesn\u2019t challenge us anymore. Therefore, if you look around, you will see tons of middle-aged men out of shape, and that\u2019s not normal! In an environment engineered to be comfortable, challenging your body is your task! Suggest to your brain the right things. Suggest to it that you are young and strong, that you are a predator and not prey! If you ask for energy, your body will give you energy to fight the entropy of our human condition. Entropy? \u201cCivilization, like life, is a Sisyphean flight from chaos.

It\u2019s an enemy that conquers territory if it isn\u2019t faced by an opponent. It\u2019s something that gains power from an imbalance of energies. An abundance of energy brings chaos. I\u2019ve already talked about the consequences of caloric imbalances in the first chapter of the Optimalism series. You are looking for comfort and relaxation, and that\u2019s normal. In nature, a condition like that doesn\u2019t exist. Resources will be depleted, and enemies will come to the doors. Do you think that",

You have to question yourself about your \u2018why\u2019 and find a deep motivation. I have found strength in various anchors over time, such as finding a partner, improving my appearance, and intimidating enemies, but as you can see, each of these motivations is rooted in the external world, which means your motivation is volatile and subject to the whims of others. \u201cLook well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look.\u201d Marcus Aurelius In other words, the real and inexhaustible force is within yourself. What you are looking for is energy, and this energy will flow from yourself if you work on your body. The body adapts and maintains balance, giving you more energy. As an anti-fragile machine, the body has developed in order to adapt. This process is called homeostasis, which is achieved through continuous, but gradual, eustress. Stress? No, eustress. A healthy and proportional kind of stress which helps your body to scale up. \u201cStress is now defined as a state of homeostasis being challenged, including both system stress and local stress.\u201d \u201cTherefore, an optimal stress level is essential for building biological shields to guarantee normal life processes.\u201d  \u201cStress functions through the stress system, and it contains three basic types: distress, eustress, and sustress. While distress may impair normal physiological function, eustress plays a critical role in the adaptive process of assessing and disposing of stressors, and endowing the individual to prepare for and survive future challenges [65],\u201d  Okay, we need some stress, but how can we obtain it in a healthy way?

First of all, the goal of this blog is to spread knowledge for free, and as the quote on the homepage says, \u201cYou can recognize truth by his beauty and simplicity\u201d Richard Feyman I\u2019ve often heard complaints about how boring it can be to follow a strength routine, but in the end, it\u2019s like cooking. You have the ingredients, and you have to follow your taste. I can give you the ingredients, but the recipe is something personal. For me, it\u2019s like a meditative experience. When it comes to training, you don\u2019t need special machinery or complex programs. The most straightforward thing to do is to create an exercise routine based on fundamental exercises and iterate it with consistency and discipline. If this isn\u2019t something you\u2019re already doing with your diet, I suggest reading the first chapter of the series, \u2018Optimalism, Starts with Diet and Discipline.\u2019 Save your money and use your financial energy to become a financial fortress. Be prepared. Remember that most of the equipment or suggestions people sell are meant to enrich themselves and create a highly profitable niche where they can operate. You don\u2019t need to waste your money, and I will explain how to do it. Keeping things simple frees up mental resources and helps you focus on what counts. Complexity brings confusion and mental burden, which can prevent us from being disciplined. There are a few exercises that help us maintain the fitness we need, and it\u2019s important to stick with them and iterate through a meditative approach. I\u2019ll start by discussing the most important exercise and what you need to create a functional gym in your house. Fundamental exercises. There are three fundamental exercises in the practice of weightlifting, and I also consider running an important task. Multi-joint exercises are known as fundamentals because they are based on a kinetic movement that involves many parts of our body, igniting many metabolic and hormonal processes. The three fundamental weightlifting exercises are the squat, deadlift, and bench press.",

It permits you to be in touch with your body, perceiving its limits but also its potential. \u201cIn this sense, many people might perform a variety of exercises under the pretence of needing to do so to increase strength and muscle size across each of those exercises. However, the present study suggests that a general strength increase is possible which might provide transference to other exercises and potentially other movements. \u201c  Core strength and flexibility. We have already talked about the importance of strength in order to sustain our body.

It\u2019s clear to everyone that when it comes to our core, not only strength is important but also flexibility. I can\u2019t stress the notion enough. Over time, I changed my approach and started focusing more on core strength and flexibility. That\u2019s because, as I said, I developed a hernia a long time ago, which I want to keep under control. These things happen when you are young and hormones outcompete your wisdom. Unfortunately, I realized only after many years the importance of flexibility and core. Crunches, planks, and stretching have become my morning routine, and now I have been practicing them for many years. I implemented them as a regular morning routine coupled with 1 hour of meditation, cold showers, and a good breakfast (a subject which I covered in my first chapter, \u201cOptimalism starts from discipline and diet\u201d). These measures applied with discipline and consistency helped me to recover and feel even better than before my injury. My back, thanks to a strong core, is now rock-solid. I can deadlift without any trouble and always feel comfortable even if I stand for hours or sit for extended periods. What\u2019s my training routine? As I mentioned, after years of reading research and listening to the experiences and suggestions of many bodybuilders, I decided that my goal was to be strong. The reason for this was to give my mind an army. What do I mean by that? I realized that my mind is nothing without a healthy and strong body to defend my bastion. I want to live longer, full of energy, and be able to protect myself from a hostile environment.

Winning increases the ratio of the former to the latter. A lobster with high levels of serotonin and low levels of octopamine is a cocky, strutting sort of shellfish, much less likely to back down when challenged. This is because serotonin helps regulate postural flexion. A flexed lobster extends its appendages so that it can look tall and dangerous, like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti Western. When a lobster that has just lost a battle is exposed to serotonin, it will stretch itself out, advance even on former victors, and fight longer and harder. \u201c Jordan Peterson, 13 Rules of life \u201cAdopting an upright seated posture in the face of stress can maintain self-esteem, reduce negative mood, and increase positive mood compared to a slumped posture. Furthermore, sitting upright increases the rate of speech and reduces self-focus.\u201d  It seems that postures have a bidirectional effect, as do many other physiological dynamics. \u201cSelf-focus refers to an individual\u2019s attention being directed inward, towards their own thoughts and emotions, rather than being directed towards the external environment or task at hand. The quote suggests that sitting upright can help to reduce self-focus and increase positivity by maintaining self-esteem and reducing negative mood. This highlights the power of posture and body language in shaping our mental and emotional states. It\u2019s interesting to think about how different postures can influence our self-perception and our interactions with others. It\u2019s also a reminder that small changes in our behavior can have a big impact on our overall well-being.\u201c chatGPT And posture depends on our muscle strength and flexibility, something simple as our posture can change how we perceive ourselves and how people perceive us, winners or losers.

My imagination began to run wild with possibilities, and I quickly realized the potential of this new tool.

I soon realized the potential for creating a chatbot for my blog and decided to try my hand at coding. During the process, I sought suggestions from ChatGPT itself on lines of code I was writing, and I started to think about the long-term consequences of this technology. While it is clear that certain jobs like journalism, education, and law will be impacted, what really captivated my mind was the opportunity to feed the model with vast amounts of writing. I initially thought of this as a way to create a digital clone of myself, but then I realized the significance of leaving a written legacy of my memories. Every article I write becomes a piece of data that contributes to my digital self.

If child_branch_factor=2, a query chooses two child nodes per parent.  It\u2019s also interesting to take a glance at how this takes shape in a code editor.

However, it is just one of the many ways to dissect the corpus, and there are options that are more or less efficient.

Cultural Assets Returning to our primary discussion, I have coined the term \u2018Cultural Assets\u2019 to emphasize the importance of expressing oneself through digital content.

In the future, it may be possible to credit the primary contributor for every \u2018slice\u2019 of this asset, possibly through an NFT linked to each message. In other words, if we create these cultural supplements, it would be interesting to understand who participated and in what quantity in the production of them, identify the main contributor and give them credit, thereby structuring a better meritocratic system. If we can tokenize every message and article, it is not difficult to envision a future where those cultural recipes will contain the weight of every element, like a nutrition fact, which connects the idea to its creators and gives him royalties in the case of art intellectual properties.

Premise. I had the opportunity to meet many amazing people and experience great things during my three-month stay in the US. There is much value and many positive aspects, including the friendly and beautiful people. However, my opinion relates to the management of the country and should not be taken as a criticism of its people, who I believe are merely victims of poor incentives. To be clear, I would like to distinguish between the expectations people have of the US and the reality I encountered during my stay. As an explorer and customer of the US Inc., I spent three months and a considerable amount of money, but I have some complaints about the customer service provided by the world\u2019s most powerful country. I was required to pay almost 500 USD for a visa, but I don\u2019t feel that I received adequate value for what I paid for, apart from the country\u2019s massive advertising campaign. Email Address First of all, the most important question, WHY? Why did I decide to spend 3 months of my life in the US? I have always been fascinated by the internet and the opportunities it provides for the dissemination of free knowledge. In the earlier part of my adult life, I focused mostly on topics related to physical improvement and conducted my research by finding materials and documents written in my native language. However, over the past decade, I began exploring the field of finance and investments, and I soon realized that it was broader than I expected and was tied to several other subjects such as economics, psychology, mathematics, evolution theory, game theory, and others. I realized that I was blind to how the \u201cillusion machine\u201d works and had an ontological shock. The best way to gain enough knowledge in these fields, I found, was through the English-language side of the web, which is mainly populated by American literature.

This is how human behavior works. I explored cities, parks, restaurants, clubs, and pubs completely alone and interacted with many people, conducting informal interviews over drinks.

There seems to be a vicious cycle where people are induced to consume energy in various forms, such as calories, fuel, and HVAC.

To achieve this, I enrolled in a language school, which allowed me to travel abroad with the permission of my employer. However, the environment I encountered was hostile, with people shouting in the streets and homeless and drug addicts lying everywhere. This was my first impression and it was not just backed up by statistics but by my personal experience. A few days into my trip, the security chief of the school, who was a former LA police officer, taught us how to defend ourselves against aggressive homeless people using just a pair of keys to kill them. He explained that some of them could be dangerous and would attack people in search of money. Although I have traveled to many metropolitan cities around the world and I am used to dangerous people, I was not prepared for the number of such individuals in the US, most of whom showed symptoms of mental distress. The local population seemed to be used to avoiding interaction with such people, which made me think about the situation if I were to fall ill or have a heart attack in the street. People might mistake me for a homeless or drug addict and not offer help. I believe that such an approach is not healthy for a population over time, and it could have serious consequences for the mental well-being of the people. This made me think about the situation in the US more deeply. Treating it only as a security issue is a shallow approach, and I believe that the US is suffering. Dismissing the problem with statements like \u201chomeless people choose to live this way,\u201d \u201cthey are drug addicts,\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s a widespread problem in the US\u201d is a simplistic and dismissive way of addressing the issue. During my brief trip, I informally interviewed several Uber drivers who said that the situation on the streets was getting worse every day. So, what\u2019s going on? During my language lessons, I noticed that the teachers discussed many troubles in the US, including homelessness, gun control, abortion, and the abuse of sedatives.",

Listening to them, I felt that they were scared of these phenomena but unable to identify the root causes. However, I am aware that teachers may align with certain political movements, and these topics may be the result of manipulation. During my travels, I realized that these were real worries and I encountered several such experiences. While I was alone in pubs and restaurants, speaking with strangers or overhearing conversations, I was often struck by the discussions about the homeless situation. For example, while I was in Venice Beach, I overheard two girls and the bartender talking about the problem. They were shocked by the situation in LA and explained that the problem has also been increasing on the east coast in recent years. Fig. 13 Broad surveys seem to confirm my thesis. One of my classmates effectively presented the issue of sedative abuse to the class through a video in which they interviewed a school employee.

However, few of the bottled waters we examined have an optimal mineral profile. North Americans may also be more likely to drink mineral-deficient bottled water, such as spring waters, rather than mineral-rich bottled water. This is because mineral-rich bottled water is generally associated with an unfavourable taste. In addition, most European bottled waters are more expensive than North American waters\u201d. \u201cThe average North American population consumes insufficient quantities of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and too much Na+.\u201d source nbci Again, the problem of taste preferences and the unwillingness to spend money for better health is prevalent.

Fig. Sovereign individual AI generated ArtWork A society where responsibility is decentralized empowers the agents of the system and incentivizes them to be more knowledgeable, reducing the risks of misaligned incentives, exploitation, and agency problems. But not everyone wants to bear this weight on their shoulder, as most people don\u2019t want a burden. However, when it becomes clear that there is no other viable option, people who believe in the need for a new paradigm can come together, align their values and principles, and create a 100% democratic nation. This will demonstrate which culture works better and encourage others to join the best culture, creating incentives for change. The purpose of Satoshi is to empower the individual by giving them responsibility. Decentralization means that everyone bears responsibility. A community where everyone is responsible is a strong society, as every element is strong and knowledgeable enough to hold the leadership accountable through exit options, which brings dynamism to the system. This must happen before the leadership becomes entrenched and causes harmful consequences for the network elements, leading to the inefficiency of the entire system. Every time a system fails, it is due to an overcomplicated set of rules that makes it difficult to determine who bears responsibility. The contract becomes a trust agreement between a smart agent and a group of ignorant parties. Modern politics, FTX, and other fraudulent companies operate in this way by creating a lot of bureaucratic layers to confuse their stakeholders (citizens, investors, users, etc.) and entrench their positions of power, exploiting their positions for their own advantage. \u201cYour task is to stand straight, not to be held straight\u201d Markus Aurelius On the other hand, if it is built from the ground up, the inevitable outcome is a network made up of aligned, knowledgeable individuals who are motivated to create something new, as they share a common vision.

If there is growth, then there are deflationary forces that compensate for the abundant liquidity, but this can only happen if there is both liquidity and knowledge. Injecting liquidity into the system without new ideas to optimize it is like trying to revive a 100-year-old man by injecting liters of adrenaline into his veins \u2013 it won\u2019t work because the patient is already dead. The more liquidity that is put into the system, the more likely it is to find its way into Bitcoin as a buffer. Unlike gold, which is a static asset, Bitcoin is a technology tool that continues to improve and find new ways to express itself. For example, it provides resources to unbanked populations, allowing them to finance their knowledge and develop themselves. Bitcoin also enables these populations to exploit renewable resources as miners, which brings them more resources to further develop themselves. Every time central banks inject money into the system, they are financing their substitute, creating a spillover effect. When interest rates increase, it\u2019s like cutting the supply during a war. If Bitcoin can resist better than society itself, it will thrive, but a period of volatility is the fragility shock that an antifragile system must weather. The big problem with Bitcoin is defining its value. It\u2019s relatively easy to do this for an earning asset, but almost impossible for Bitcoin.

Yes, we are what we are today because of a series of improvements obtained thanks to some biological adaptations, mainly caused by genes but not only. It seems indeed that the best tool we have gained through evolutionary processes is mainly the consequence of our ability to handle food, our cerebral cortex growth was exponential when we discovered how to cook and conserve food, this gives us regularity in our meals and the ability to feed ourselves in tranches of more digestible food instead of having irregular big meals of raw food. Fire gives us the opportunity to delegate part of the digestive process to the fire\u2019s energy; indeed fire makes the digestive process less energy demanding, increasing the absorption of nutrients, unlocking these excess energy to cognitive processes. \u201cMechanisms contributing to energy being gained from cooking include increased digestibility of starch and protein, reduced costs of digestion for cooked versus raw meat, and reduced energetic costs of detoxification and defence against pathogens.\u201d pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Fig 3.

Source: faculty.ksu.edu.sa If fire were the technology which brought us to the sapiens level, probably something tied to the manipulation of nutrients will bring us to the next level of our species. I\u2019m not a doctor but I think I have sufficient brain power (and surely the same holds true for my followers) to improve my diet by myself using the research that I can find from respectable resources around the web and experiment this new discovery on myself, feel my body and understand what makes me healthier and what prejudices my wellbeing.

Fig. 5 How the errors starts from infancy Interesting because society teaches young people what tastes good therefore young people teach their parents where and what to eat. Who is the educator here? Ok Dave but this shit is tasty! Our perception of good or bad, beauty or ugliness, good taste or bad taste is highly dependent on our culture. If you grow up in an environment where sauces, sugars drinks, and low quality beef between two pieces of low quality bread are highly advertised, all your friends eat Mcdonalds too, and therefore most of your childhood memories are tied to a Fast Food, you will probably associate fast food as one your best experiences. Having a healthy lifestyle requires effort and the willingness to recalibrate our taste buds, in other words align our concept of tasty with the brick of a healthy diet. Most of us are addicted to sensory perceptions, like for example the sweet taste which does not exist in a natural environment but the industry energizing in order to enslave us to inexistent taste, investing the money distorting our short term brain sensations at the expense of the nutritional contents for long term health consequences. This quote by David Deutsch in my opinion is perfectly applicable also to taste, because taste is a form of beauty, a sensorial feeling of something good. \u201cCould it be purely cultural?",

Perhaps we see a face as beautiful because it really is, or perhaps it is only because of a combination of our genes and our culture. A beetle is attracted to another beetle that you and I may see as hideous. But not if you are an entomologist. People can learn to see many things as beautiful or ugly.\u201d David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity The same in my opinion is applicable to good or bad taste. \u201cThe attribute we call beauty is of two kinds. One is a parochial kind of attractiveness, local to a species, to a culture or to an individual. The other is unrelated to any of those: it is universal, and as objective as the laws of physics.\u201d David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity Food is attractive because of a good marketing companion and ingrained cultural roots and there is objective good food, a meal with genuine products which not only satisfies our taste but is also engineered to improve the performance of our chemical factory, named body, some examples at the end of the article.

Mental performance and emotional stability. Even if I started primarily focusing on physical performance, I reach the conclusion that the main goal of a diet is mental performance. Qualitative food, exercises and fasting are part of a progress through the enhancement of our ability to absorb more information, connect more dots and become more creative. Our brain is an organic CPU and through a multidisciplinary approach we can learn how to gain some horsepower and reduce the noise. The body itself is the litmus paper of our progress and not a final goal, It shows us if we are going in the right direction.

In other words, we are addicted in a similar way to a cocaine junkie. Why does sugar reward us? Because in nature finding a high energetical source of food is a business which requires determination and tenacity, there is an equilibrium between energy delivered and conquered energy. An incorrectly calibrated reward system can bring us into depression and anxiety, evolution sets us to be rewarded when we accomplish something great for our tribe, not because we pay to feel rewarded, that creates tons of trouble along the way. Then when you will reduce your sugar intake brace yourself for the classical withdrawal symptoms, or maybe you will go in denial mode and you will deny your addiction. \u201cIf a dietary approach to treating psychotic symptoms was suggested, what might this regime look like? Glycemic index (GI) describes the rate of absorption of glucose from carbohydrate. High GI carbohydrate foods, such as white bread, sugar and refined cereals, cause a \u2018spike\u2019 in insulin and blood glucose (followed by a dip). Low GI carbohydrate foods, such as wholegrain bread and most vegetables (or foods containing little carbohydrate at all, such as nuts, seeds and meat), produce a slower insulin response and thus a more steady supply of glucose to the blood. Low GI diets induce weight loss and improve blood glucose control in people with diabetes. A recent meta-analysis showed that people following a low GI diet had more weight loss than other diets [48]. \u201c\u2026\u201cStudies of the effects of low glycaemic index diets on dopamine release are yet to be carried out, however anecdotal reports suggest an initial discomfort and craving after starting this regime, which suggests a component of withdrawal.\u201d\u2026\u201cThe common link drawn between eating, psychosis and mid-brain dopaminergic reward,",

Nutrition Our body is like a machine, therefore just like every machine, it needs a correct mixture of molecules and compounds to work efficiently.

What I immediately understand is the importance of testosterone and growth hormone e their response to various type of food: Testosterone This hormone is incredibly important for the body composition but not only, it is also for our mind giving you more energy and more focus, it seems also that it positively affects memory. Optimizing its productions seems like a good idea. It seems again that the foods we introduce in our body mainly affects our cognitive skills. A part of our testosterone is converted into estradiol (an estrogen steroid hormone, the major female sex hormone) by a process called aromatase. Body fat levels increase the amount of testosterone converted, and therefore if our goal is to optimize the production of these hormones, then a low level of body fat is required. On the other hand though, as our body uses fat to metabolize testosterone, then it is important to have a balanced amount of fat in our diet, removing fats from our diets is a common mistake in this sense. Growth Hormone There is a connection between growth hormones and sugar, it seems indeed that in a hypoglycemic state our body produces an exponential quantity of HGH, the role of HGH is to maintain a healthy body composition and preserve muscle mass. \u201cthe mean GH response was significantly diminished when the men received glucose (8.12 \u00b1 1.12 ng/ml) compared to that when they received only water (23.70 \u00b1",

In other words we understand that stars and the harvest are connected but we have developed a flawed narrative based on the assumption available to us in that time frame. The narrative fills the gap between our lack of understanding of the world and reality; we must be open minded and accept uncertainty. Genes or environment (habits)? Your lifespan is only 20% genetic. The rest is up to you. Take your epigenome into your own hands.

And again\u2026 capitalism and sick incentives.. What did food industries do in order to adapt to an environment where people are interested in looking good? Tons of products with added Proteins and Amino Acids, they sell the illusion that if your snack is full of protein then it is healthy, instead it seems that an excess of amino acids is negatively correlated to our longevity. We evolved in a scarce ecosystem, thus our body is wired to eat whenever there is an occasion and in the meantime we, as a society, developed an ecosystem of abundance but our body still signals to us to eat as much as possible because there is uncertainty about the fact to be able to eat tomorrow in a natural environment. The current reality is that we have an abundance of food and our goal is to live long and healthy and not necessarily survive for a week. We can fast,",

Are there alternatives? Yeah, the incentives depend on the single components of our society, if knowledge spreads as a meme and we decide to be healthier, we can do it and we can claim a healthy support from the market. If you can create little tribes where the incentives are healthy aligned we can create a community which can efficiently compete inside a dynamic system and become stronger overtime, obtain resources and grow more strong and spread the healthy memes which can change our world. \u201cThe world\u2019s major cultures \u2013 including nations, languages, philosophical and artistic movements, social traditions and religions \u2013have been created incrementally over hundreds or even thousands of years.

Leaving aside the illegality of their assumption, if we don\u2019t properly understand how our ancestral body works and how every part interacts in a holistic manner, we will end using some short cut to reach the wrong goal, that is the apparence. As we saw, this stability is given by a deep understanding of the functionality of our body, hormones, insulin, autophagy, \u2026 With roids you\u2019ll still be ignorant. You don\u2019t learn how your body works and that short cut will prevent your knowledge from growing and appreciating the positive and reinforcing adjuncts on your well being compared to a correct and well built nutrition.

These awards aren\u2019t donated but are the results of the holistic understanding of our body and how it interacts with our ecosystem.

Phoenix source: wikipedia Greeks had given us another great symbolism about rebirth. Fasting is a homeostatic effort which improves our antifragile system (antifragility article), as the phoenix has to die in order to rebirth even stronger. During fasting your body will give you signals of surrender, as is always the case when homeostasis is tested, but if you survive from a psychological standpoint you will rebirth stronger. Warning: educate yourself about the importance of electrolytes and risks tied to fasting before starting this practice, tell your intentions to your doctor and understand that fasting will test your body which will surely rebel against your decision to deprive it of food. Supplements evolution I leave supplements as the last point because I think it is worth taking a supplement only if our diet is perfectly balanced, then some vitamins could help where our nutrition lacks completeness.If we discover the fire (thanks Prometheus), and this technology gives us a competitive advantage, why not use technology to develop tools to further unload our digestive system and in the meantime improve the range of micronutrients we absorb. I personally limit myself to the intake of a qualitative multivitamin, there are tons in commerce, find the best one and add it to a complete diet. In this sense I appreciated the letters of the CEO of one of those supplements company (Not affiliated) \u201cDespite all prevailing evidence and studies showing that many chronic diseases are preventable if early action is taken, our healthcare system has chosen to focus on the most expensive way to treat people \u2013 a focus on sick-care rather than well-care.

At the end of the day, it\u2019s always a question of price. At the right price every asset could be a buy. I tend to agree with the last years of the investing practice of Buffett: \u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u201d Warren Buffett This is because at the start of his career Buffett followed the preach of his teacher Graham, which developed his reasoning during the \u201829 crisis, and he was",

Sometimes even defined by Graham as \u201ccigar butt\u201d, heavily discounted companies in regard to their tangible assets at the point that the value of the assets itself was greater than the price of the security. Then in a liquidation event (bankruptcy), the investor would have received back the proceeds of the fire sale (only after bondholders). Today, especially in the developed market, we rely on services and technologies which are asset-light businesses. What does the switch from asset heavy to asset light means? Book value (the value of the assets found on the balance sheet) are less valuable in respect to the past. Today we have companies with a high barrier to entry, a powerful brand with mindshare and strong network effects, which produce high profit with less assets. Think about that, if I have a strong intellectual property as a new superhero character named DScompounding, if this superhero has a digital platform of distribution with network effect (e.g. Netflix) with the superpower of the \u201ccompounding effect\u201d, it can replicate itself over the planet through every device of the Netflix network, as for example your phone, the phone of your friends. But what is the cost of the product? There is a cost of related to the character creation, its advertisement, and the cost of technically realizing the platform of distribution, but today with cloud this costs can be minimized and, if I can reach scale with my platform, the cost of another copy of my movie with Dscompounding Superhero will be approximately ZERO, this give me earnings power even if I can maintain a low price because the cost of distribution is low. In other words, our world becomes less Atoms and more Bits, our digitalization as a species reduces the cost of our entertainment (deflation), because Bits are replicable (leaving aside Bitcoin, this is another interesting story, for another interesting article, think about Digital Scarcity, we will return on this topic). Why this apparent deviation? I wanted to highlight the importance of Cash generation over Book value. \u201cIt is important to understand,",

        "text": "the importance of Cash generation over Book value. \u201cIt is important to understand, however, that the two terms \u2014 book value and intrinsic business value \u2014 have very different meanings. Book value is an accounting concept, recording the accumulated financial input from both contributed capital and retained earnings. Intrinsic business value is an economic concept, estimating future cash output discounted to present value. Book value tells you what has been put in; intrinsic business value estimates what can be taken out.\u201d Warren Buffet Discounted Cash Flow Formula But, don\u2019t fool yourself, the math I am going to analyze is only a basic equation explained first by John Burr Williams in his book \u201cThe Theory of Investment Value\u201d published in 1938, and then elaborated by Warren Buffett and other great investors of our times, isn\u2019t rocket science. Fig 2. Discount Cash Flow Formula source: The Theory of Investment Value, John Burr Williams, 1938 As you can see, the formula is very simple. The logic behind is better explained by a simple example. Imagine you built a lemonade stand near a beautiful beach in some exotic country. As we have seen in the last article a business has some costs related to the activity. Some of this depends directly on the production of the lemon juice (COGS) for example the lemon itself, but even commodities such as the sugar. Then you have to pay the stand where you produce the drink, the land where your activity stands, the machinery to squeeze the lemons. What you will gain depends on how much lemon juice you sell (Revenue), how much you pay to your supplier for the commodities you use in order to manufacture the product (lemon, sugar), how much you will pay to buy/rent the land where your juice factory stands, and how much it will cost to then buy and replace the squeeze machinery (depreciation). In the end, your profit depends if customers come to your stand or to a competitor one. Then, you have to have good marketing to build a brand (mindshare) and good relations with your supplier,",

If everything works for the better, you will soon start building new lemon stands around the globe and you will need to hire new staff and employ someone who will manage the company for you. You will get the profit as an owner, and in the meantime you can sunbathe at the beach instead of working at the stand. This is a simplified summary of what we had seen until now. \u201cWhy Stocks Go Up and Down\u201d by William H. Pike is a great book to deepen the subject (Books) Now, what if you want to sell the ownership of the lemonade international enterprise? At what price do you sell it? Or, in our case as value investors, at what price will we buy it? Note: A Moat is imperative to ensure the realization of the future cash flow, the Moat is what gives us some degree of certainty about the future cash. Without a competitive advantage our margin is threatened and the future cash flow with it. (14. It\u2019s a War) For that reason, this blog isn\u2019t just about a simple formula, but the formula we discovered today is only a piece of the grand scheme of things. As explained by Buffett \u201c [\u2026] the formula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by a very smart man in about 600 B.C. (though he wasn\u2019t smart enough to know it was 600 B.C.). The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, investment insight was \u2018a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\u2019 To flesh out this principle, you must answer only three questions. How certain are you that there are indeed birds in the bush? When will they emerge and how many will there be? What is the risk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)? If you can answer these three questions, you will know the maximum value of the bush\u2014 and the maximum number",

And, of course, don\u2019t literally think of birds. Think dollars.\u201d Warren Buffett Buffett\u2019s quote implied a series of notion: Time Value of Money = a sum of money in the hand as a greater value than the same sum to be paid in the future. The implied uncertainty of the future discounts the value of tomorrow\u2019s money. Opportunity cost = a more compelling opportunity arises, for example a company with a better price, or more simply, the business you are currently valuing doesn\u2019t grant you a good rate of return in the next few years, maybe because the price is too high, then a US treasury (known for its absence of risks = risk free) is a better alternative. We can restate the first formula now with a better understanding Fig 3. Formula There are some details we have to add to properly understand it. Free Cash Flow was treated in the last article (17. Cash Flow Statement Analysis). Required rate cant be explained simply by how much compounded rate of return we will obtain over a period of time by our investment (6. The eighth marvel of the world). There is not much to add. There are some notorious investors, for example, which they mentally do this calculation or some others which use some shortcut like for example P/E or EV/EBIT. These metrics are named as relative valuation tools, because they are used to compare different investments. Relative valuation looks more simple at glance, the trick is that in these simplified relationships between financial numbers you imply some underlying numbers without clearly expressing them. We will see in the Python code the number of assumptions we have to define in order to obtain the intrinsic value. As we know, the future is inherently uncertain, then every assumption is an error node in our process to reach the range of possible intrinsic value. Mauboussin suggests that given that the stock price is known, we can use a reverse DCF, reversing it to understand",

        "text": "stock price is known, we can use a reverse DCF, reversing it to understand what assumptions the market implies in the stock price and if our assumptions are more or less optimistic. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, instead, is part of the tools named Absolute valuation. What\u2019s the difference? As I explained, the risk free rate used as a comparative hurdle in order to discount the cash flow is highly dependable by the US Treasury. Then if the US Treasury rate changes, the valuation of the whole market changes, thus the multiples (e.g P/E) will decrease. This is the consequence of the variable change in the DCF model of the investor involved in the market which defines the price in relation to the opportunities costs, defined at the end by the Federal Reserve through the interest rate (short explanation, not detailed because beyond the meaning of this blog). If we use a DCF we are forced to make explicit some variables. Sounds complex to understand?

Damodaran scheme Relation between Value and Price Until now we have analyzed the Value of our stock, we already have discussed the notion of Moat, we had dug through the financial statements all of this in order to try to hypothesize the future cash flow of our company. But, the ultimate goal of our efforts is to buy a company which will appreciate in the future, then we need a discount in respect to the current price. To enjoy this appreciation we have to buy it undervalued and sell it when the price converges with our estimate. How that happens? Here prof Ben Graham helps us: \u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine.\u201d Benjamin Graham In the short run, as greatly explained by the fig. Momentum and mood, group thinking and liquidity (liquidity: it\u2019s the stock easily tradable? Or maybe, because of its size, it\u2019s difficult to buy the stock without affecting the volatility?). In other words, our psychology and Mr Market (8. Mr Market) psychology affects the price. But as explained by Graham, over the long term (PATIENCE!!!) the price reverts to the value of the underlying business. I have a suggestion from Mark Twain. It\u2019s a simple phrase but I suggest you think about it, write it down somewhere and reread it when panic arises and you see users on investing forums, your neighbors, your parents, your colleagues start thinking all in the same way, as a herd of lemmings (herd mentality, yes we are animals and our tribes and societies are herds.). \u201cWhenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.\u201d Mark Twain And be careful even when some great investors start panicking, maybe there is some reason you don\u2019t know. Think before acting, even if your favorite investor does something that scares you. The words \u201cIt\u2019s going to zero along with every other hotel company in the world. \u2026",

Catalysts The catalysts are events which bring the Market to evaluate a stock multiple (How much I want to pay for the current/future earnings of this business? Aka P/E). I personally concentrate my effort on great businesses which compound their cash flow, then the cash flow growth is the catalyst. A good management manages to realize the value through investment with high ROIC, buybacks and special dividends (non-recurring distribution of company assets). \u201cMr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to either ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence. Indeed, if you aren\u2019t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don\u2019t belong in the game.

At the end of the day it\u2019s all about uncertainty. To rephrase it, when we invest, we are betting on the future and we are trying to protect ourselves by spotting flaws in our cognitive process. Margin of Safety I want to briefly introduce this notion, I will dig into it in a future article, but I feel the need to give you this tool. Now you are ready to look around and search for bargains to buy within your range of fair value. The assumptions used are uncertain therefore the prices are ballpark figures and not precise. For that reason it\u2019s important to understand the notion of Margin of Safety, Seth Klarman wrote a book on it, then I can\u2019t condense the entire idea in a few words, but the basic idea is to buy with a buffer that takes care of uncertainty and errors tied to our calculation. We as investors discount the price to preserve/ protect ourselves from our own ignorance. This can be likened to a bridge that is built to support more weight than permitted by the technical specification, despite having to remain solid if, by chance or in error, an overweight truck passes over it. Yes, we are ignorant and sometimes arrogant, neglect it could be dangerous. Fig 9. Margin of safety \u201cA margin of safety is necessary because valuation is an imprecise art, the future is unpredictable, and investors are human and do make mistakes. It is adherence to the concept of a margin of safety that best distinguishes value investors from all others, who are not as concerned about loss.\u201d\u201d Seth Klarman A margin of 5%? 10%? 20%?

Email Address This discipline goes beyond the simple research of money, but it encompasses the whole spectrum of human existence, passing through psychology, history, charity, adventure and discovery. Nick Sleep itself named it as \u201cOur adventures in capitalism\u201d. Sometimes we research adventure in sci-fi movies or Netflix series, on top of that I find this a more interesting adventure, an adventure into the real world, an adventure which puts yourself to become a better thinker and more knowledgeable about our reality. Free market, in this sense, is a feedback machine. We use our brain to formulate hypotheses, and the market assesses our hypothesis. Like all adventures, an adventure hides dangers, but even great opportunities to become free and enlightened, more creative, and more productive. Free time for yourself, over and above that, for our family and for the entire humanity. The purpose of this blog is to journal my personal adventure, as a diary, where I share what I learn, and the path I trace. Charity and philanthropy are always capital allocation activities, as they are investing in the stock market, but oriented to humanitarian purposes. As in the Sleeps\u2019 case , indeed Nomad Partnership ended in 2014, and today Nick Sleep is active in the philanthropic field through the I.G. Foundation. In the investing section of their website you can find the entire collection of letters.

Previous generations that retired in old age and died soon after, have not always had that opportunity. As we said in the preamble, we have not entirely left investing behind either. \u2026 Investors can think their way to success without seeming to work in the traditional sense and the payoff in capitalism from stock picking can be extraordinary. It is one thing for capital allocators to be rewarded for their efforts but, in our opinion, taking personal identity in everything above X-amount is not a route to building a better world. We suspect that: if you made it to the end of our letters, then you are one of the good guys and know that already.

An seemingly impossible venture for a common man. For that reason the protagonist is usually helped by a mentor (The Helper) who gives him a light in the dark (Principles and Tools), and a dose of courage to abandon the herd and take responsibility for his own journey. Lastly the helper warns the protagonist about the journey\u2019s dangers (Temptations). There is a hero inside of everyone, and for everyone of us there are virtuous mentors.

But then, with the Partnership closed, we do not have many incremental dollars to reinvest. \u201c \u201cBill Miller argued that there are three competitive advantages in investing: informational (I know a meaningful fact nobody else does); analytical (I have cut up the public information to arrive at a superior conclusion) and psychological (that is to say, behavioural). Sustainable competitive advantages are usually a product of analytical and or psychological factors, and the overwhelming advantage with regard to Nomad is the patience of the investor base and the alignment of that disposition with the analytical and psychological traits of your manager. It simply would not work otherwise. In the investment objective section of the Nomad prospectus, we say that our job is to \u201cpass custody [of your investment] over at the right price and to the right people\u201d and that \u201cthe approach will require patience\u201d.

Second, the stock market posts prices every day, this is the equivalent of making your opponent chose his dice first.\u201d \u201cIn a traditional capital cycle framework, the high valuation of these businesses encourages a supply side response, which eventually undermines the economics discounted in the stock price. \u2026 Indeed, human nature being as it is, we can almost guarantee that capital spending will continue to grow until share prices decline. \u2026 For such stocks to be a viable investment for Nomad we would have to feel confident that sector economics are not discounted in prices several years out and, given the rise in capital spending plans, that is not the way to bet. And this is Nomad\u2019s great strength. By looking out five years we do not have to invest in shorter-term phenomena in order to look good this year. And in our opinion that is at the heart of what is driving the frenzied trading in Phelps Dodge \u2013 the desire to look good this year, quarter, month, week, or just today. When there is a frenzy of activity in one area of the market there is very often an anti- bubble of discarded companies. In the dot com era these were companies with steady cash flow. \u201c \u201cOperating inside the bubble, it is hard for many participants to see this. The author Upton Sinclair, commenting on the attitude of businessmen and almost one hundred years to the day before the current credit crisis, had it about right, \u201cit is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary (or bonus) depends on his not understanding it\u201d.

That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes that, with zero R&D for the next ten years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at U$64?

Retreat and simmer, mull it over and a period of incubation ensues with the unconscious mind deployed; 3. Whilst doing something else a solution to the problem surfaces (Archimedes\u2019 eureka revelation); 4. Go and verify the new solution.

It also discusses the concept of the equity yield curve, which argues that returns increase with time in the equity market, and the importance of understanding the character of a firm in order to achieve success. Finally, it emphasizes the importance of taking time to think and the need to label information for its fact content in order to avoid confusion.",

The first is in our control, that is, it is in our control to be patient and wait for the right price. The second involves a subjective judgment about the quality of management, and an assessment about the sustainability of business returns in the long run. It is these factors that occupy almost all our time. \u201c \u201cOur aim is to make investments at prices we consider to be fifty cents on the dollar of what a typical firm is worth. Capital allocation by investee companies must be consistent with value creation and, if this is the case, we expect that the real value of the business (the 100 cents value) could grow at around 10% per annum. The effect over five years will be to compound U$1 of value into U$1.62, and companies that can build value like this are normally rewarded in the market with a fair valuation (i.e., are priced close to U$1.62). This happy outcome would imply a return from purchase price (50 cents) of around 26% per annum. So, what happens when we are wrong?

Typically, it connotes the purchase of stocks having attributes such as a low ratio of price to book value, a low price-earnings ratio, or a high dividend yield.

Correspondingly, opposite characteristics \u2013 a high ratio of price to book value, a high price-earnings ratio, a low dividend yield \u2013 are in no way inconsistent with a \u201cvalue\u201d purchase.\u201d Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1992 Annual Report We won\u2019t end the debate here but, so that we all understand, Growth is therefore inherently part of the value judgment, not a separate discipline. \u2026 and why do commentators continue to use price to book ratios, price to earnings ratios or their modern equivalents such as EV to Ebitda, as a proxy for value.

A simplified version of the Kelly criterion is that investors should bet a proportion of the portfolio equal to 2.1 x p \u2013 1.1, where p is the probability of being right. The common-sense outcome of this equation is that if one is certain of being right, one should invest the entire portfolio in that idea. Even if one is say, 75% certain of being right the correct weighting remains high at 47.5% ((2.1 x 0.75) \u2013 1.1). But does anyone do that? But is this not the right way to think? If you know you are right, why would you not bet a high proportion of the portfolio in that idea? The logical extension of this line of thought is that Nomad\u2019s portfolio concentration has at times been too low. And if it has been too low at Nomad, what has been going on at the large mutual fund complexes with many hundred stocks in a single country portfolio?

As the jewel becomes diluted by less successful projects aggregate performance declines and valuations atrophy or even fall.

Mind share and brand awareness also preserve profitability but it goes beyond the scope of this article. Inflation accentuates the competition, namely the rationalization in the uses of scarce resources (commodities). Thus the unavoidable consequence, for an over indebted western world, it\u2019s to convert the labor force in an automated process (Software is eating the world \u2013 Marc Andreessen), namely the perfect optimization of the resources with a reduced environmental impact. I see a natural trend that is resource rationalization. We follow that line since the beginning of the species, there is some volatility, but the millennial trend is here to stay. We are more and more on this planet, we must become more and more able to optimize our space, even building new dimensions (metaverse) or discovering new ones (space). The last injection of liquidity by central banks accelerated this trend. Side note: nat gas, water, healthcare, education, commodities and product/services are not localizable and difficult to automate. By the way there exists a solution for that, offered once again by technology, called the metaverse, to begin with digital socialization (social network), job digital environment (WFH), through digital education. It works if we implement global and portable digital certifications, as for example a Proof of Attendance (POAP)., These are all activities requiring less commodities and less energy (think about taking the car to go to work and the energy used to run he building where you work, or the physical mall where you do physical shopping, moreover think about the physical space occupied by this buildings, it\u2019s a waste of scarce resources and space. Even more obvius the digitalization of paper as a mean to transfer and storing informations, the results is the preservation of forests, another scarce resource).

The transaction to the metaverse has already started, metaverse being a series of intermediary destinations. At the moment, I see an investing opportunity in owning these infrastructures, an intermediate crisis is highly probable, but past this moment our species could be free, freeing our time, and thanks to digital infrastructure, reducing the friction in our communication physical and emotional.

Its role in calculating the intrinsic value of a company CF Equity/levered and CF Firm/unlevered Some useful metrics Cash flow in the context of the maturation stage As we saw in the first article, the income statement uses the accrual basis accounting, in other words, it tries to match revenues and expenses at the time when the transaction occurs. The cash flow statement recognizes the transaction when the money is transferred. This absence of further manipulation, sometimes, defines a more honest picture of the business, for that reason I particularly like this statement, and it\u2019s a good idea to always reason in terms of Cash in and Cash out. Email Address I used the engine allegory to define the income statement, but the real fuel of our company is represented in the Cash flow statement. The energy generation of an engine depends on the efficiency of the system, indeed electric motors are more energy saving, than internal combustion engines (ICE). The latter are also known as heath engines. In thermodynamics, a heat engine is a system that converts heat to mechanical energy, as is the case for the ICE because this engine work by burning fuels to release heat through chemical reactions and eventually producing mechanical thrust. But,what does financial statements have to do with thermodynamics? Because we are going to search for the engine with less energetic dispersion, in other words, the more efficient company. Our money is the fuel and we want the best energetic returns for the fuel we inject. In the Cash Flow statement we can check that efficiency. What are some examples of \u201cenergy dispersion\u201d? Wrong investments. Spendthrift manager (i.e, who pays for expensive headquarter, private jet, \u2026). Absence of competitive advantage, which leads to tons of money burned in marketing expenses or trying to keep up with technology innovation without gaining extra cash.

Cash Flow Statement scheme Damodaran \u201cLook, son, at the end of the day it is all about cash-in, and cash-out\u201d. Nomad Letter 2011 The logic behind the Cash Flow statement is simple, we have: Cash Inflow: Revenue from goods and services, loan receipts, cash dividends, interest earned, asset sales, grants, any form of cash received. Cash Outflow: Payroll, capital expenditures, supplier payments, taxes, commissions, interest paid, costs tied to the operations, rent, debt payments, equity investment, repurchase of common stocks, dividends. Ideally, our goal as investors is extracting cash overtime from our business, as a landowner wants to extract rents from his tenants through the collection of rents. As I said, engine fuel gives us kinetic energy through chemical and physical processes. Thanks to the income statement and the cash flow statement, we can check how much energy goes wasted in the process of generating our wealth. We are going to scan our engine with a thermal visor detecting money dispersion and managerial inefficiency. You can think of companies as a wealth engine, differently from an ICE engine, our engine will compound over time making us rich, in article 7. How companies reward us we already covered this point. The ultimate goal of the free market is efficient capital allocation (long-term efficiency!). Your goal is to rationalize your cognitive process in order to discover efficient allocation, the engine with less energy dispersion, and a modern and efficient electric engine.

Another thing to consider, is that cash flows are said to be harder to manipulate than earnings, so many investors tell you to just ignore earnings and look at the cash flow statement instead. I usually look first at the income statement, and if it is interesting I dig deeper and take a look at the Cash Flow Statement. Qualitative earnings convert a great portion into cash flows, frauds usually report strong earnings numbers, but generate little cash, it is a red flag. This happens because the accrual method lends itself to be easily manipulated, unlike the cash accounting (which hidden some traps too). Fig 3. Spredgar comparison of EPS and the free cash flow of Enron Enron was an American energy, commodities and service company. Enron filed for bankruptcy in late 2001 after a series of financial frauds.

Operating Cash Flow Fig 5. OCF scheme Damodaran As you can see from the Damodaran scheme, we use the indirect method to reach our Operating Cash Flow figure. In other words, we start from Net income and we add back non-cash expenses. Operational Cash Flow represents the cash generated by the company business operation, in this sense in my opinion is the most important part of the statement. The Cash Flow Statement has another advantage respect to the income statement, since it is an honest representation of the cash generated by the company in a given period it leave out non-cash expenses (e.g D&A Depreciation and Amortization, SBC Stock based compensation) and some gain unrelated to the operation of the business, as is the case for the gain of the marketable securities investments.

The logic behind the Cash Flow statement is simple: Cash Inflow includes revenue from goods and services, loan receipts, cash dividends, interest earned, asset sales, grants, etc. Cash Outflow includes payroll, capital expenditures, supplier payments, taxes, commissions, interest paid, costs tied to the operations, rent, debt payments, equity investment, repurchase of common stocks, dividends, etc. The Cash Flow Statement is said to be harder to manipulate than earnings",

Mauboussin, Morgan Stanley Cash is always the King! GAAP and non \u2013 GAAP Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) The GAAP is a set of accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The GAAP\u2019s aim is standardized financial statements and allow the comparability of the financial information. Public companies in the US must follow GAAP to compile their financial statements. For example the Operating Cash Flow described above is a GAAP figure. Most of the companies in the US represent their accounting figures under the GAAP accounting principle. Non-GAAP Sometimes companies manufacture nonstandard metrics. Some metrics could be useful, some others could be misleading. It\u2019s always good to stick with GAAP numbers and always be wary of non-GAAP numbers. The most commonly used non-GAAP figure shown by management is the Free Cash Flow. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) IFRS is the counterpart of GAAP, but adopted outside the US, as GAAP, IFRS are a set of accounting rules for financial statements of the public. The rules of IFRS are beyond the scope of this article, to dig into the topic I suggest you read the investopedia write-up. Free Cash Flow An example of a non-GAAP financial measure is the Free Cash Flow. It is an important figure, because it tells us how much money is left to pay us.

A company which \u201cwaste\u201d too much money, usually, doesn\u2019t have a strong competitive advantage, this competitive advantage takes the form of a brand which maintains a market leadership without incessantly investing to keep up with new competitors which tries to conquer the market (15. Income Statement \u2013 Mindshare). As we saw, Capital expenditure could be divided into Maintenance and Growth. Rarely, companies show two different figures. Often we have to estimate it (my suggestion is to always be conservative). We have to deeply understand our business to draw a line between the two Capital Expenditures. What interests us, as investors, is the cash will arrive in our pockets in the future. That cash arrives in the form of dividend, buybacks or even investment for the future expansion. As explained in the last chapter (16. Balance Sheet Statement \u2013 ROIC), the Return on invested Capital (ROIC) represents the return on the capital the company invests in the business. If a company has a high ROIC (15%+) we can expect this as our future stock return, then if they can maintain this level, as intelligent investors, we prefer that the company spends the cash generated in order to fuel new projects which expand the business and the future Cash Flow.

Indeed the math behind the company growth is: g = ROIC * RR g = growth ROIC = Return on invested Capital RR = Reinvestment Rate (which is the % of Net profit reinvested) Eventually, we want to obtain even more cash per unit (stock) by means of buybacks (shrinking the piece of the pie) or reinvestment in high ROI investments which increase the future cash flow (increase the cash per share, which eventually, in the late stage of the company, will lead to buybacks, which in turn lead to even more cash flow per share and ultimately lead to a huge cost basis dividend per share). The logical consequence is that, if a company can\u2019t find opportunities to reinvest the money at an high ROIC, repurchasing their own stocks could be a better idea in order to increase owner\u2019s value, if the stock is already overvalued the last thing to do is payout the Cash in the form of dividends. FCF Equity (Levered CF) and FCF Firm (Unlevered CF) There are two types of FCF: levered and unlevered. Levered reduces the FCF taking into account financial obligations (debts) Unlevered free cash flow is before mandatory debt payments are paid (lenders, investors, interest, etc.). Levered free cash flow is cash left after paying all the debt due during that period (scheduled interest, principal payments and fee), whereas Enterprise Value (already discussed in the article 16. Balance Sheet) is market cap adjusted for all debt and cash/cash equivalent. At the end of the day, FCFF (Firm) is the cash flow owned by stockholder and bondholders, thus tied to the value of the entire capital structure, Enterprise Value. FCFE (Equity) is the cash owned only by stockholders, for that reason we paired it with the Market Capitalization, namely the price paid by equity investors. Both should give you a similar valuation if you look at the averages. In a specific year they can be very different. FCFF (Unlevered) = OCF + Tax adjusted interest expense \u2013",

Change in Net Working Capital = Net Working Capital for Current Period \u2013 Net Working Capital for Previous Period Some companies have a negative working capital.

CCC is used by management to see how long the company\u2019s cash remains tied up to its operation. CCC = DIO + DSO \u2013 DPO Cash Inflow: DIO, Days Inventory Outstanding = the average number of days the company holds its inventory before selling it DSO, Days Sales Outstanding = the number of days of average sales the company has outstanding Cash Outflow (because of that ->minus sign in the formula): DPO, Days Payable Outstanding = The average number of days the company takes to pay its bills. A short CCC means better efficiency in the cash generation, freeing cash to make additional purchases or pay down outstanding debt.

This is called the principal-agent problem, and it arises when who makes the decision on an asset, s/he is not the same as who owns the assets, then the likelihood of a moral hazard increases. Openinsider.com permits to check buy and sell positions of management and employees. For example, Steve Jobs took a salary of $1 from 1997 to 2011. However, during this time his stocks increased from $17.5 million to $2.2 Billion. Another signal of skin in the game, is a founder leading a company, a founder who invests a lot of time and energy, his work and energy often goes further than the grit of a hired CEO. \u201cWe have ended up with a portfolio of owner-managed businesses as a byproduct of our assessment of the quality of the people involved. In other words, these managers earned their way into the portfolio. We feel slightly foolish for not recognizing this trait in advance, but, of course, we would have a bias toward founder-managed businesses (duh!).\u201d Nomad letters, Nicholas Sleep Usually stock buybacks are welcomed with exultation by investors, interpreted as a net gain for owners, the reality often is that these buybacks only compensated for the stock issued as a payoff for management and employees (nothing wrong with this, but SBC is a real expense). So far, I have spoken highly about buybacks (Berkshire Hathaway is good example), indeed I think share repurchase is a useful tool in order to reward shareholders, but you have to dig about the balance between share issuances and share repurchase in order to understand if there is a real gain for us, or only an escamotage, adding back SBC to OCF could be a viable alternative. \u201cTo say \u201cStock-Based Compensation\u201d is not an expense is even more cavalier.

CapEx is depreciated in the Income statement over the useful life. Expenditures and expenses obviously depend on the sector, some sectors have high costs, caused by the need of a lot of raw material/buildings/marketing. A good example of a heavy capital expenditure sector is the airline business (other examples are automobile manufacturers, oil/gas production, steel, telecommunication, railways, \u2026). On the other hand, some businesses tied to software or web platforms, like for example Meta (Facebook), have low capital expenditure and high scalability (Asset light companies).

It\u2019s important to understand the capital structure and be conservative when it comes to the value of the debt burden. It\u2019s also important to understand the purpose of the debt. I analyzed the debt question in the article on the Balance Sheet. As useful metric to understand at glance the sustainability of the debt burden is the following: Cash Flow to Debt = Cash Flow from Operations / Total Debt A high ratio suggests that a company is able to pay back its debt and consequently take on more debt if necessary, this metric varies widely across industries.

If a company is overpriced an able management could issue more shares in order to obtain cash for investments, consequently this means that the shares are overpriced then we have to re-value our position. Here the notion to reiterate is that if the company has the chance to invest money in a high ROIC venture, it is better to do it than to repurchase the stocks, it\u2019s alway a matter of capital allocation and opportunity cost. Common dividend paid Cash Dividend Payout Ratio = Common Stock Dividends / (Cash Flow From Operation- Capital Expenditure) It\u2019s better to use Cash Flow because Earnings as an accounting figure is easily manipulated. Here it is worth paying attention to the % of FCF distributed as dividend, if the % is too high, or worse, it is more than the FCF, maybe the dividend if financed through debts, this is a warning sign. Financing a dividend with debt is the recipe for big problems and a warning sign. Value trap: a decadent business which tries to retain shareholders offering a juicy, but unsustainable dividend, maybe it works in a 0% interest environment, until the music stops. \u201cI have a certain distrust of firms with generous dividend policies, and so should you.

What\u2019s interesting about the company is that after this strong initial growth, its revenues have been virtually flat over the last ten years. This pattern of rapid growth followed by a sudden and extended flattening in results has historically been a recipe for horrific stock market returns. Over that same period of time, however, Pre-Paid\u2019s stock appreciated fourfold, dramatically outperforming both the market and its industry peers. How did the company achieve these results? Starting in late 1999, its CEO, Harland Stonecipher, realized that his market was maturing and that additional investments in growth were unlikely to have attractive returns. At the urging of his board (which, unusually for a public company, included several large investors), he began a systematic and aggressive program of optimizing free cash flow and systematically returning capital to shareholders through an aggressive stock repurchase program. Over the next twelve years, Stonecipher bought in over 50 percent of shares outstanding, to the sustained applause of his shareholders and the stock market, and in June 2011, agreed to sell his company to a private equity firm for a significant premium\u201d William N.

In the next article I will tell you what we learned until now, in order to define a range of prices for the companies we are analyzing.

An example: Every sort of debt, often used to finances the acquisition of an assets, which will generate cash to repaid the debt interest, and generate additional income (e.g., mortgage) Here we can note the importance of producing more earnings than the cost of the obligation (interest rate) aka Return On Capital employed. If not, the company is burning cash. In other words, if I assume a debt of 100 and I have to pay an 1% interest, and I use this money to develop a project which returns <",

Despite this, its stock appreciated fourfold, outperforming both the market and its industry peers. This was achieved by CEO Harland Stonecipher's systematic and aggressive program of optimizing free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders through an aggressive stock repurchase program. This pattern of rapid growth followed by a sudden and extended flattening in results has historically been a recipe for horrific stock market returns, but Stonecipher's strategy was successful in this case. The key takeaway is that Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is not always a matter of sales growth, and share repurchase can be an excellent alternative for a stable Free Cash Flow (FCF). It is important to remember that future cash does not have the same value as the cash in our pocket today, and investors must consider the risk/reward mixture when making investments.",

Even if the company manages to service its debt, this payment decreases the cash flow available to pay shareholders. When a company downsizes its debt burden, it releases money for shareholders: dividends, repurchases and investments. Remember: the true nature of investing regards the money the company pays us, not the price set by Mr. Market. (article 8. Mr Market) Equity Simply put, this is your piece of the cake. What amount of money, hypothetically, would be returned to you as an owner if the company would be liquidated. Equity can also be called book value. For some sectors or businesses, book value per share can be a useful metric (notoriously in the past Warren Buffett buybacks $BRK stock under 1.2 times book value, as a sort of proxy to define the intrinsic value, indeed a smooth growth in equity could be a good sign). Example: individual = Equity is what belongs to you after you deduct the mortgage of your house from the total value, that\u2019s the Equity of your home.

You can see the potential of a business that has excess cash to deploy in a series of new projects, even in uncharted and risky territory. These ventures are named optionality and companies like this are named spawners.

BVPS = Shareholders equity / number of shares. Now it is clear why the Balance sheets are useful and important, because they define what we own, as investors. Intangible Something forgotten by accounting is the importance of intangible assets, namely the money spent by the company in order to develop new technologies (Research & Development R&D) for developing a brand (Sales, General and Administrative SG&A), for training specialized labor forces (COGS) or create a new intellectual property. These items are not capitalized (transformed into an asset then depreciated overtime), but those intangibles have a long term value, mostly in our tech oriented society. In other words, this money spent will generate real assets, even if they are not represented in the balance sheet, rather those intangible assets are treated as cost and immediate expense. Brand, franchising, trained labor, intellectual property, customer lists, reputation, culture, loyal employees, data, those are only some examples which share some of the features of physical assets, and they can generate cash flow over time.

Intellectual properties could be an eternal money mine with the difference that a mine needs physical infrastructures which in turns needs maintenance, Mickey not. Furthermore nobody else can own a Mickey Mouse. What does this mean? In an inflationary environment, your maintenance/replacements costs are going to increase, reducing the profit margin, that doesn\u2019t happen with IP (intellectual property).

Obviously this is an extreme example. But it is worth noting that the Disney empire is founded on assets which do not appear on the balance sheet, it will appear only if someone, in a hypothetical future, will buy Disney. Because of the earnings power, the buyer will have to pay a premium over the equity. This premium is named Goodwill, but doesn\u2019t exist in the previous balance sheet of the acquired company, because the assets are not tangible.

However, debt is a social problem. When an individual, a business or a society brings more debt than is productive output, there could be a problem (unless you are the reserve currency printer, namely US, but this is another story \u2013 Lyn Alden Petrodollar). Fig 6. Public US debt % GDP Interest rates are low then, having some debt, could be a good idea, but only if that more money is used to generate wealth in the long term. For example, having a huge pile of debts and paying high dividends to the shareholders may seem a good idea, but in reality is the sign of a myopic management with a short term vision. High level of debt means high level of interest to pay, this interest will reduce the cash our business can pay to us as owners, moreover this debt burden must be rapaid sooner or later, reducing future cash generation. Some companies rather than lower their dividend and lose their investors, those companies use debt to payout dividends, that increases debt services and reduces the future gain. In other words, it is the action of a short-sighted management and it will be detrimental for long term shareholders. It is useful to compare cash and long term debt in order to understand how much net debt the company has. Why do some companies have cash and debt? There are many reasons. The first reason is the tax advantage. Another reason worth noting is that some companies are international, then they have assets in foreign currency exposed to local devaluation risks to compensate for this devaluation the company takes a debt in the same currency, in order to take advantage of local currency devaluation without trapping money in countries with weak currency. Leases Lease is a contract between two parties, where the lessee pays the lessors for an asset use. Be careful, capital leases are counted as liabilities. A new FASB rule, effective Dec. 15, 2018, requires that all leases unless they are shorter than 12 months must be recognized on the",

Number of common stock We have already discussed the notion of share repurchases (how companies reward us). I want to highlight an aspect, companies not only repurchase shares, but sometimes they issue new fresh stocks, having the opposite effect: namely diluting the stocks count thus devaluing the value of a single stock. You can think that: stocks are like money, a store of value. Companies can pay investors, employees or even what they need with stocks. We, as investors gain, when there are fewer stocks, because in this manner we own a big piece of the cake. On the other hand the management could pay itself and the employer with stocks (Stock Based Compensation). Nothing wrong about it, if employees and management are themselves owners could mean that they act like owners in the interest of us, as investors. This is a complex argument that needs a separate article, but it is worth remembering for the next article where we are going to analyze the cash flow. Other than that it is good to look at the number of share counts over time in order to understand if the company is diluting our earning participation. The management must treat shares as if they are gold bullions, nothing wrong using stock as a currency, but only if the exchange is worth our gold bullions. Fig 7. $AAPL How a good CEO makes his shareholders rich through share repurchases managing the balance sheet When you are trying to catch the last overpriced hot stock with uncertain financial future, remember this chart and think about how the wealth is created. Wealth is created over time by a cash machine business and a management aligned with shareholder interest!

Net Working Capital (NWC) The NWC is the difference between current assets and current liabilities.

The consequence could be the reduction of Cash Flow in order to weather the short term liquidity issues. Ratios and metrics Ratios are useful to compare the historical data and data between companies, it is worth remembering that capital structure can vary between sector and maturation stage (e.g., Some capital intensive sectors have a huge debt burden. That could be a normal or a mature company with stable earnings that could have an high credit rating, thus this will pay much less in borrowing costs. ) Fig 8. Company life stages source: Prof Aswath Damodaran The table on fig. 8 by Prof Aswath Damoradan is useful to contextualize the figures, every stage of the life of the company has its optimal blend of assets/debt/equity. Return on Equity (ROE) ROE measures the financial performance and corporate profitability of assets owned by investors. It is useful to define the ability of the management to make profit with our money. It defines how much profit is generated for each shareholder dollar. Earnings growth can never exceed ROE. Be careful, a high ROE is not a guarantee of growth. ROE = Net income / average shareholders\u2019 equity \u201cFocus on Return on Equity, not earnings per share\u201d Warren Buffett Be wary, in order to understand the results we have to know the capital structure. Basically, if equity is the result of Assets \u2013 liabilities, the more liabilities we have the higher is the ROE. Keep in mind, there is not a magic formula, but we need a holistic approach. Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Similar to ROE but with a different denominator, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is used to evaluate the capital allocation ability on total available capital.

However, if a company has a competitive advantage, the MOAT will protect the ROIC. Even if you pay a high price, over the long term if you buy a great company with a high return on capital your Total Shareholder Return (TSR) will be good. It is worth remembering that these metrics are alway past looking, in other words we are looking at past performance. Past data are useful to understand the management ability, but they are not certainties for future returns. \u201cIn the business world, unfortunately, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the windshield.\u201d Warren Buffett This means two things: The art of investing is the ability to use past numbers and stories to help us to hypothesize the existence of a MOAT, and the ability of the management to defend and improve this MOAT over time. That is the secret to maintaining the past performances. We, as investors, use this data and our future outlook to choose the investment with the best probabilistic chance to realize a gain. For that reason I\u2019m obsessed with the idea of finding companies with a wide competitive advantage. The past uses of capital is a responsibility of the management and condition of the past. It is entirely possible that the recent Capital Allocation has become better or worse, but our metrics pay the price of past weak decisions (e.g., if management in the past overpay for an asset, this excess can weigh on the balance sheet). Ideally, we want to assess the present capital allocation decision, but almost always, we have the data of the entire asset\u2019s story of the business, and we can\u2019t assess the Return of Capital for every single project.

I want to highlight the thought of one of the most influential economists of the 20th century: \u201cIn chemistry and physics and other natural sciences the object of experiment is to fill in the actual values of the various quantities and factors appearing in an equation or a formula; and the work when done is once and for all. In economics that is not the case, and to convert a model into a quantitative formula is to destroy its usefulness as an instrument of thought.\u201d JM Keynes Investing is an art, formulas are useful, but the complexity of investing cannot be captured by a mathematical formula.

Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient.

They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple",

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines.

To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin.

R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers.

Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture.

Thorndike, The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success Finally, net income must be positive! I remember you, our purpose is to find the best company and don\u2019t lose money. More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond. From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we",

Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing",

Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages.

Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.).

How to avoid being caught in a bubble? Stick with fundamentals and your circle of competence (10. Circle of competence). Invest in a company that you know and that generates cash now.

We fight because our planet has limited resources, and we need to use them efficiently, this is the only way to survive as human beings.

(E.g., renewable energy are going to destroy oil/gas, e-commerce vs brick and mortar, cryptocurrencies vs FIAT currencies, AI/blockchain/data are going to automatize bureaucracy and will free our species from the burden of bureaucracy/routine works in order to free our limited time and unleash our creativity.) Imagine a future world, with 30 billion people, where we will occupe thousands of surface meters to allocate gigantic off-line malls. Doesn\u2019t seem an efficient way to occupy the limited space of our planet, it seems better to have an efficient warehouse coordinated by robots with a virtual showcase ($AMZN) in a metaverse (SEHK700) where we can walk around thanks to virtual reality ($FB). That could permit free space for gigantic woods and parks in the real world. Maybe once there was a desert, now it was a forest. Maybe Thanks to a startup like Solar Water, where you have invested, that uses solar energy to power a desalination plant).Then stop complaining about the fact you are going to lose your job because of automation.

EDGAR search engine In this digital environment, we have a lot of choice where we can find financial forms, but EDGAR is the main source of information, the only place that you can trust. Then, in the second place, but sometimes less reliable, is the Investor Relations page of the company itself. \u2026but what about 10-K. In the 10-K management talks about everything about the company, starting with detailed information about registered office addresses, the number of shares outstanding, the management discussions about: the company\u2019s future, the idiosyncratic and systemic risks, detail about management key people, current and future investments. You can also find detailed financial information and any current or past lawsuit. Learning to invest? 10-K helps you to understand the business but also tells you how the management defines the value of current and future investments, in quantitative and even in qualitative terms. Other than that, management discusses geopolitical topics. You can easily throw away the newspapers, what you need to know about our world, it is readable on the 10-K of a great company that operates worldwide. In other words, you are going to find the signal and what really counts. Understand the CEO In this document the CEO talks about the company, then you can understand what type of person is the person who administers your money, because this is the CEO work, decide how to invest your capital with the goal to earn the maximum return (capital allocation). There are some characteristics we can extrapolate from this filing about the CEO, for example, if s/he realizes the past promise and if s/he is honest and reliable about the company condition and future prospects. Obviously, you have to take her/his words with a grain of salt and skepticism, but is a good starting point to dig about her/his figure.

The first time I read a 10-K form, I thought it drew a very grim figure of the company, that\u2019s good because it allowed us to take note of the risks. Investing is the art to face uncertainty and understand the risks and rewards of an investment decision, therefore a good management doesn\u2019t hide the negative aspects of the business. Remember: any investment decision involves risks, it is our job to understand risks and create a basket of companies that through a deep understanding and a bit of diversification allow us to reduce those risks. But what really matters is knowing the CEO and being sure about his honesty to convey all those risks. Competitors To understand the big picture, it is useful to also read competitors\u2019 10-k, this gives you the opportunity to better understand the sector and the risks. It\u2019s important to have a competitive advantage over the competitors to thrive, the 10-k tells you what competitors are doing and the difference between the economics of the companies in the same sector.

        "text": "why there would be a place for the crypto in a balanced portfolio. I\u2019ll suggest you to read my article about inflation first (Article 5.1 Appendix inflation). It\u2019s essential to understand inflation in order to give a sense to our reality.Cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin (BTC) suffered the classic bubble price evolution, in the past, even housewives speculated on Bitcoin.The result of this behavior, like almost every bubble, is that many people who believe they are getting rich, but in reality, they lose money. (Article Mr Market) Consequently, they have lost confidence in cryptocurrencies and even in the investing world. But being caught in a bubble is our fault, it doesn\u2019t mean that the underlying securities don\u2019t have value. Fig 2. BTC price chart Now, cryptocurrencies are bets, we don\u2019t know what the future holds for them. If we invest in a company that delivers products, we could expect that those products will still there in the future, and this dynamic will generate money for us as investors. In the case of cryptocurrencies, we can\u2019t apply the same reasoning.Cryptocurrencies are asymmetric bets (upside much greater than downside) against adverse macroeconomic events or simply bet on a digital revolution in the financial sector, a bet on an unorthodox and alternative future where central banks and governments lose control of inflation levers. What is a currency? A currency is a medium of exchange. What happens if that medium loses value? Simply, our savings lose value (inflation). What\u2019s the main difference between FIAT currency (e.g., USD, CHF, EUR, YEN, RNB, \u2026) and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is?The scarcity, in other words, Bitcoin is a finite resource like gold (21 million is the finite number of BTC). Indeed, historical, when there is a debasement of the currencies, people run to buy gold. Perhaps your anxiety about Bitcoin is the volatility of the price. Forget about volatility, you must reason over the long period where daily/monthly/yearly price action has no meaning. \u201cWhen an investor focuses on short-term",

Taleb In the short term, price fluctuations are random events, these are unpredictable.We have to think of risk/reward terms over the long run. I heard the crowd shouting about the instability of bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies. But what if volatility is only the first phase of the acquisition process? I mean, capitalization is low and there is a lot of uncertainty, but if step by step people will gain trust, volatility will decrease. Who will decide which will be the winner? Gold has value as a storage of value because we had decided so as a human collective. A long time ago, there were no more efficient ways to store value. \u201cIn this sense, it\u2019s more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value\u201d Satoshi Nakamoto 2009-02-18 The advantage of cryptocurrencies over gold is that: I don\u2019t need a vault to secure my wealth.

A smart contract can literally vaporize the financial and bureaucratic complexity of our times, allowing a plumber in Mumbai to make reliable contracts with his customers without being backed by the institutions.

I have to say that I\u2019m a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and this decision make me happy for two reasons: 1) Buffett felt that BRK was undervalued, this means that I bought BRK at a fair price. Basically, my evaluation was right from Buffett\u2019s perspective. 2) The price of BRK rises propelled by share repurchase, therefore my wealth grows. Fig 3. Second buyback period. An important lesson we can extrapolate from this event: A good company uses his money to invest in his own business when Mr Market (8. Mr Market) throws good prices. But the most important point is the balance sheet of the company. In other words a lot of cash and low debt, in this way, when the crisis comes, management can take the opportunities that arise from. \u201cIn the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity\u201d Sun Tzu Not every management repurchases shares in the best moment, often managers repurchase shares when the price is very high. In periods of widespread optimism, many managers in order to please shareholders and to exercise their options (Management stock options: we will return on this point, ELI5: benefits to management if stocks reach a certain price) they do buybacks in the worst period, when the stock price is overvalued. Fig.3 Boeing ($BA) shares rep and debt pile Fig.4 Boeing ($BA) stock price Those two images are enough to explain what goes wrong with Boeing. Managers repurchase shares when the price was high, moreover, they do buybacks while piling a lot of debt, instead of doing that with cash produced by the business itself (Free cash flow). I\u2019ll remind a notion that I have already explained in a previous article: if managers repurchases shares when the price is high, they reduce the total ownership less than if they do buybacks when the",

Cryptocurrencies are bets against adverse macroeconomic events or a digital revolution in the financial sector, and have advantages over gold such as not needing a vault to secure wealth and being divisible and transportable. Governments may try to repress decentralized cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin is antifragile, making it difficult to prevent it from spreading. Inflation is a strange beast, and Bitcoin is a bet on a financial revolution that may start.

Therefore, fewer shares outstanding implies more value for us as shareholders. \u201cWhat is smart at one price is stupid at another\u2019.\u201d Warren Buffett In the end, I want to point out the difference between investing and speculating. Speculators buy stocks waiting for another buyer who pays more and they gain thanks to the difference, an investor instead buys a business and his gain depends on the quality of the management and the cash generated by the business itself. The former hopes to find a buyer, sometimes only more fools than him. The latter invests in the business for the long run and gains because of the business itself not for the willingness of other speculators to pay more for the same piece of paper.

It\u2019s unnecessary to read the results of every quarter, but suffice to read the statements at the end of the fiscal year. We are looking for increasing revenue, a strong balance sheet and high margins, and we are looking for a management that is able to reinvest our money in the best way possible. Remember: we want to invest in a small number of businesses in the long run, then we have to understand how those businesses work. Stories Numbers aren\u2019t enough. I\u2019ve to confess to you that I don\u2019t like math, I prefer stories. Indeed, this is my favorite part of investing. The main goal of qualitative analysis (stories) is to understand the business\u2019s side that it can\u2019t be quantified in numbers terms. For example, understand how the persons behind the decision are, make an inquiry about the CEO. Who is? From where s/he came from? What did s/he do in the past? Did s/he grow in the firm culture or s/he is external to the company? Moreover, we want to know the goal of the firms and the culture inside the firms. Culture defines the value within the company. Consequently, the value and the attachment of the employers to the firm, happy and determined employers give a strong background to the firm, attract new and qualified people who want to work in the company. But even more important is the satisfaction of the customers who can be our friends, our parents or maybe ourselves. We don\u2019t have to go far to find some answers.But what we want to know above all is: what is the competitive advantage of the company? This part will be subject to future articles, because the competitive advantage is a crucial point, and it lies in the most part in the narrative side of the analysis. A competitive advantage allows the firm to survive and become stronger over time. Warren Buffett defined the competitive advantage of a company as the moat of a castle, a series of intrinsic attributes of a business that defend it by the outside attacks",

The investing world is so vast and sometimes complex (often because Wall Street wants to make it look so, together we learn not to be afraid), the better way to master the game is to start by defining our boundaries. Fig 1. Wall Street Choose your battlefield! There are a lot of financial instruments which it is possible to put our money. This blog is already limited to earning assets (ELI5 \u2013 investments that deliver stable returns) tied to real business, namely stocks. Other opportunities in the field of investing are real estate, real estate investment trusts (REITs), bonds, derivative instruments (e.g.stock options), commodities (like gold), currencies (USD, CHF,..), cryptocurrency (I know a lot of you waited this moment :D) and so on. If you want to dig about those other opportunities, I invite you to do your research, in other words: Ask Google. In my opinion, some of the instruments I cited aren\u2019t investments but rather speculations. So why did I choose stocks? Simply because products of entrepreneur decisions are often things that we need, and sometimes we use. It is simpler for me to understand those things. Some products are simply needful, then it\u2019s likely they deliver returns over the long run. Do you remember?

Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, owes some of his fortunes to Coke (KO). He invests a lot of money in it, and he becomes rich even thanks to this soft drink brand. The interesting side of this story is that he started his love story with the brand when he was young. When he was a child he collected a refund from recycled Coke bottles. Over time he never lost his passion about the brand. He bought his first share in 1988. Then he never sold, instead he bought more over time, when Mr. Market (article 8.

In this excursion into high-margin retailing, I duly observed the extraordinary consumer attractiveness and commercial possibilities of the product. I continued to note these qualities for the next 52 years as Coke blanketed the world. Only in the summer of 1988 did my brain finally establish contact with my eyes\u2026What was already the world\u2019s most ubiquitous product gained new momentum, with sales overseas virtually exploding. Of course, we should have started buying Coke much earlier, soon after Roberto and Don began running things. In fact, if I had been thinking straight, I would have persuaded my grandfather to sell the grocery store back in 1936 and put all of the proceeds into Coca-Cola stock.

As you can read in the \u201cMr. Market\u201d article, sometimes the agents that make up the market follow an irrational behavior.Tesla (TSLA) for example in one week lost over 30% of its market value. While in the last six months, the market value has grown by 700%. Be Rational! We have to be careful, here isn\u2019t a rational attitude behind those movements. Moreover, these movements are so fast and violent.When people invest and follow the momentum caused by the herd instead of a rational cognitive process, the risk of losing our mind is high.When the price goes up the classic thought is: \u201cI\u2019m missing the chance of my life to become rich, buy a boat and have a Bilzerian\u2019s lifestyle\u201d. That is called FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).When a stock goes down the thought could be: \u201cOMG I will lose all my money and I will have to go live under a bridge\u201d.It is scientifically proven that money loss hurts more than happiness follows a profit (Source: PhD Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences), moreover, a money loss stimulates the brain side that processes the physical pain (source: Hidehiko Takagashi \u2013 Kyoto University).

Quantitative analysis requires financial statements numbers, which can be found in the quarterly issue form produced by the company. Qualitative analysis requires understanding the business\u2019s side that can\u2019t be quantified in numbers terms, such as understanding the people behind the decisions, the goals of the firm, and the culture inside the firm. It is important to understand the competitive advantage of the company, which allows the firm to survive and become stronger over time. Warren Buffett defined the competitive advantage of a company as the moat of a castle. There are many financial instruments to invest in, such as stocks, real estate, bonds, derivative instruments, commodities, and currencies. It is important to develop a circle of competence and understand what one is interested in and what one is good at. Warren Buffett's success with Coca Cola (KO) is an example of how one can become part of a business for the long haul. It is important to be rational when investing and not be caught up in the herd mentality. Money loss hurts more than happiness follows a profit, and it is important to remember that we are value investors.",

You can use the total market capitalization (share price*number of share outstanding) divided by total earnings (most publicized company\u2019s data), or simply by divided share price for earnings per share (EPS).You can find this data on finance.yahoo.com, usually, P/E is already calculated and shows as one of the first data.Metrics and ratios are used in the field of a relative quotation, namely allowing you to compare at a glance various companies in the same industry or to compare the same company over time.With this first simple metric, you can do for yourself an incomplete evalutation of Tesla (TSLA).

Life, economy, business. The economy follows a cyclical pattern, the same is true for human life and business life but we will dig deeper into business life when we will talk about valuation. Economic cycles are mainly defined by the relation between credits and debts. The best explanation on this matter was published by Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Hedge Fund.If you want a more comprehensive description I invite you to watch his video lesson on youtube How the economic machine works.I think is important to understand the basics of how the economic machine works in order to be a good investor. Time Value. Basically a debt is an agreement between two parts that money given today (principal) will be repaid in the future with a premium (interest). It\u2019s obvious that if I give you a sum of money I expect to be paid for the time that my money is in your hand.In other words, with this money I can do various things that give me a return, then if I decide to give you this money, I lose the opportunity to invest in other things that could have a return. This is called the time value of money and it is one of the most fundamental notions in finance. The power of debt. Meanwhile, you have my money, you can use this money to generate a profit greater than the interests you will pay to me. Typically banks are the main lenders in our system but individuals, too.

The principle doesn\u2019t change.All those entities ideally borrow money with the goal to create more wealth in the future in order to repay the principal plus interest and make the gain. The best example to describe those dynamics is a simple business like a farm. Imagine that a farmer has already a land, paid with his own money. Now he wants to sow wheat but he doesn\u2019t have a tractor, the farmer has 2 choices: saving for months until he can buy the tractor or take a loan and buying the tractor now, this means earn already now. An obvious part of future gains will be utilized to repay the principal and to pay interest, but if he does the math he can earn more and he will develop his business.I have deliberately left out debts related to private consumption like a new TV, new car, new tablet because is not a matter of this blog and I think is a stupid use of this instrument.Instead of getting into debt to buy useless stuff, learn the art of saving. \u201cDo not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving.\u201d Warren Buffett This mechanism creates the economic cycle, the time where we get into debts and we grow and time where we have to pay back this debt then our spending capacity decreases. When we get into debt, usually because central banks adopt expansionary policies, productivity explodes boosted by low-interest rates. Fig 1. Debt cyclization \u2013 source Economic Principles Long term horizon. This can\u2019t last forever then there will be the reverse process. However, in a healthy economy, the productivity line will grow in the long term. Fig 2.

Article by Warren Buffett promoting value investing, published in the Fall, 1984 issue of Hermes, Columbia Business School magazine. I\u2019ve a confession to say: I\u2019m a Value Investor or at least is what I aim to be.I\u2019m sure a lot of you are wondering about what means to be a Value Investor.To be a Value Investor is counterintuitive because it isn\u2019t in the nature of human beings to behave like a Value Investor.It\u2019s precisely for that reason that it is the right path to follow. Do you remember? In the last article (8. Mr. Market) I spoke about the contrarian attitude of a good investor.It\u2019s very hard to be a contrarian because humans like animals are subjected to herd bias. Why is it so hard to be a contrarian? Because animals in the middle of the herd tend to behave like the other members of the herd, mostly when there is an upcoming threat and little time to think what to do.Under pressure and in the middle of uncertainty we will follow the herd because we believe it\u2019s safer to stay with the crowd. I would say that most of the time this is true, but sometimes the herd reacts in an emotional way through a self-reinforced pattern, because every member follows the next fellow and that generates a chain reaction (bubble, in the case of the stock market.

But because we don\u2019t have infinite capital, we have to buy at the right price!What does it mean to be a value investor? Or what is value investing?.In the past article I broadly defined the concept when I spoke about the importance of thinking about yourself as a business owner, then like a business owner what it\u2019s important for you are the business performances not what price Mr. Market offers you for your business.As usual, I sum up the question with a quote: \u201cAll intelligent investing is value investing, acquiring more than you are paying for. You must value the business in order to value the stock.\u201d Charlie Munger Over time what counts about a business isn\u2019t the emotional attitude of Mr. Market or the economic cycle. What really matters is how much money the business makes in order to grow, repurchase its own stocks or pay a dividend, the price follows the right path in the long haul. Fig 3.

Roughly speaking; agents that compose the market (institutional investors like pension funds or retail investors like us) offer a price for any security exchanged (for example stocks) on the market.The price depends on the money that any agent is willing to pay to another agent for a given stock (company\u2019s ownership) i.e law of supply and demand.Said that, it is obvious that inside this market there is a lot of human nature, in other words: emotions.Fear, greed, envy, pride, self-esteem are components of human nature that characterise the market auction based dynamics.At this point the situation becomes complicated, because the market can be seen as if it were a person itself, namely Mr Market.The best explanation was stated by Benjamin Graham, father of Value Investing, and revisited by Warren Buffett. \u201cMr. Market is kind of a drunken psycho.

Tesla (TSLA) stock chart 2019-2020 As you can see, Tesla stock more than quadruples its value in less than 6 months, anyway the fundamentals financial valuation metrics don\u2019t fluctuate in the same way over the short-term. A simple example is the market value of Tesla. At the moment Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is double than Toyota even if Tesla sells an infinitesimal number of cars compared to Toyota.Clearly that isn\u2019t a sufficient analysis, anyway is better to be careful about the stock price skyrocketing.Conversely in the long run, fundamental data of the business and the price we will eventually converge.For that reason you don\u2019t have to focus on the short term fluctuation, if not to take advantage on the discounted price. Your wealth will generate over the long term.What causes that short term fluctuations? As I said early, the stock market has an emotional reaction to any short term news that click bait media throws us.The modern world is full of news, data and information, this because there is always someone making a living thanks to your click on the last news s/he writes.The secret is to concentrate on fundamentals data and not on the latest news on CNBC network, and that\u2019s the goal of my blog.But if you are enthused about Tesla\u2019s chart, I will show another chart that shows you what happens when emotion takes place of rationality.

        "text": "they are the first allowed to claim their money if the company goes bankrupt. There is a sort of hierarchy of claim where the shareholders are the last allowed to claim their part of the company\u2019s wealth after default.This mechanic put the shareholders in a risky position but even gives us the probability of a better gain.Bondholder return is given and limited while return for shareholders is potentially unlimited.But don\u2019t worry, that risk can be managed and I will explain to you how to do it in future articles.Our objective is to find good companies that pay us back as much as possible.This idea is called \u201cCapital allocation\u201d. Namely find where to put money in order to obtain the maximum return on capital. Returns are essentially divided in 3 main ways: Dividends Buybacks Retained earnings Dividends The most simple and direct method that companies use to share their profits with investors. Dividends are a percentage of the total amount of the capital invested that is pay back monthly or yearly.For example Coke Company pays a dividend of 1.64 USD for every share that in this moment worth approximately 46 USD per share (08 august 2020), this dividend is 3.4% of the total capital you had invested in. Usually this dividend is destined to grow over time. Fig 2. Coke dividend growth Buybacks Another option to share profit is through stocks buybacks.Company buys its own shares in order to reduce the number of circulating shares, doing so investors gain thanks to the rise in percentage owned by the company.For example: if I had a company that was worth 100b and I divided this company into 100 pieces (stocks), every investor owns 1/100 of the company and therefore 1/100 of the profit. But what happens if I remove 10 pieces of this company shares? Now the remaining investors own 1/90 of the company or in other words a bigger piece of the pie.A good management buys back stocks when the market price is below the intrinsic value. What is intrinsic value? I will explain in future articles. Summing up, intrinsic value or fair value, it is the value of the firm based",

Like the value of a car is based on the horsepower or on the brand\u2019s value.Remember: the value of a company IS NOT the market price.The price is only what the other investors are willing to pay for receiving the ownership of the business. Last but not least point is: Retained earnings Companies keep profit for a lot of tasks.It seems silly that the company doesn\u2019t pay their earnings to us.In reality it is the best option but only if we trust in management competence.If management has good ideas and it knows how to use your money to grow the business, you will gain thanks to organic growth of the business itself (development of a new product) or through smart acquisition (for example when FB acquired Instagram). That growth will increase the pie size and then the value of your ownership, that it will recognised by the market in the future, in others words the stock price will increase. Fig 3.

If the next year the bank will give you another 4% interest rate and you don\u2019t withdraw money at the end of the year, you will end with the initial amount of 1040USD plus interest, but this time the interest would be 4% of 1040USD that will be 41.6USD for a total of 1081.6 in year two.This pattern will be followed for the following years and it will become exponential. Below you can see the result after 30 years of compounding for only 1000USD at 4% yearly without further deposits. Fig 1.

If there is a lot more money, this money loses value. Fig 1. US Dollars debasement What does it mean for those who don\u2019t invest? It means that the value of their bank account decreases over time.Today interests on bank accounts are very low, much less than the inflation that affects your currency.Another reason to invest even just in an Index fund, like I spoke in the last article.

Fig. 1 source Federal Reserve As you can see in the US the circulating money is growing and that money goes into the pockets of those who invest. For example, I often heard people complaining about riches. The difference between poor and rich is that the riches take assets through the investing practice, while poors take liabilities because they spend all their income for short-term futile purpose. With passive investing method you can buy through a fund a piece of a sector, a country or even the entire world and partecipate in the wealth growing. An example is S&P500. Fig. 2 source Wikipedia This is a bouquet of the 500 largest US companies, in finance this instrument is called \u201can index\u201d, specifically in this case is called Index Fund. For the 10 years ending December 31st 2019, had an annual compounded rate of return of 13.2%, including reinvestment of dividends. Fig. 3 Compound interest on last 10 years of S&P500 on a initial investment of 10000 USD to 34000 USD As you can see in the long run the growth of the Index follows the path of the growth of the circulating money. S&P500 is only an example, there is plenty of index for every nation or sector. Exchange Traded Fund Today we have specific financial instruments that mimic the trend of the various indexes. This instrument is called Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). ETFs are exchange like stocks and the main issuer of this instrument are Vanguard or iShare.An example is SPY, if you have a bank account you can ask your consultant about this option.

Growth of knowledge, new jobs and wealth for all the citizens, plus we can enjoy new products and innovation.We are the engine of evolution and money is the fuel. \u201cOverall capitalism [meaning free markets] is intrinsic to the human species.

The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain.

        "text": "that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles.

To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article.

The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?).

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A).

Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle",

How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be",

Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over",

I have always been fascinated by the internet and the opportunities it provides for the dissemination of free knowledge. In the earlier part of my adult life, I focused mostly on topics related to physical improvement and conducted my research by finding materials and documents written in my native language. However, over the past decade, I began exploring the field of finance and investments, and I soon realized that it was broader than I expected and was tied to several other subjects such as economics, psychology, mathematics, evolution theory, game theory, and others. I realized that I was blind to how the \u201cillusion machine\u201d works and had an ontological shock. The best way to gain enough knowledge in these fields, I found, was through the English-language side of the web, which is mainly populated by American literature. It\u2019s not surprising that the US, with its winning model and cultural network powered by its reserve currency status and attracting smart people and investments, has become the center of information.

People are more likely to be open when you are alone. You appear less threatening when you are outside of your group, and other groups are more willing to engage with you. This is how human behavior works. I explored cities, parks, restaurants, clubs, and pubs completely alone and interacted with many people, conducting informal interviews over drinks. What I quickly noticed is that most Americans are heavily focused on consumption. There seems to be a vicious cycle where people are induced to consume energy in various forms, such as calories, fuel, and HVAC. To sustain this massive consumption, the quality of products is deteriorating, which is especially noticeable in food and clothing. It may seem strange to start my narration talking about consumption, but it was my strongest impression. I thought, \u201cWow, these people are overconsuming everything, it\u2019s simply mind-blowing.\u201d Every time you order food from a fast food restaurant (which is the predominant eating option), you realize that you are consuming almost nothing, mostly carbohydrates, and low-quality protein without much flavor, unless it is accompanied by a sugar-based sauce developed in a laboratory to stimulate our taste buds and release neurotransmitters that give us the impression that we are eating something good.

I also found that the lack of quality was not limited to food. At one point, I was shopping in an outlet store with a special discount on top US brands and I observed the poor quality of the products. The textiles were fragile, and the printed logos were likely to fade after a few washes, forcing people to throw away the product and buy a new one from the same brand, satisfying some sense of hierarchy. Due to inflation, the quality is expected to decrease even further. Companies with strong brands and significant advertising budgets can maintain their earning power by lowering the quality of their products and deceiving customers into thinking the product is excellent. Food is the best example of this. A Turo rental car driver once told me, \u201cThe solution to the rising food prices is to eat junk food.\u201d As prices soar, consumers turn to McDonald\u2019s (cnn.com).

It is not surprising that those with power desire more. My assumption is that the free market responds to the demands of the population and sometimes defines their needs through well-made advertising campaigns (those with more money can have a greater influence on society). However, culture acts in opposition to this. Culture is a set of knowledge that serves as a fundamental value for society\u2019s agents and decentralizes power by placing the responsibility on each citizen, just as Satoshi did with finance through a self-custodial protocol.

Although I have traveled to many metropolitan cities around the world and I am used to dangerous people, I was not prepared for the number of such individuals in the US, most of whom showed symptoms of mental distress. The local population seemed to be used to avoiding interaction with such people, which made me think about the situation if I were to fall ill or have a heart attack in the street. People might mistake me for a homeless or drug addict and not offer help. I believe that such an approach is not healthy for a population over time, and it could have serious consequences for the mental well-being of the people.

Individuals should choose to drink bottled water with an optimal mineral profile, i.e., high levels of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and little Na+. However, few of the bottled waters we examined have an optimal mineral profile. North Americans may also be more likely to drink mineral-deficient bottled water, such as spring waters, rather than mineral-rich bottled water. This is because mineral-rich bottled water is generally associated with an unfavourable taste. In addition, most European bottled waters are more expensive than North American waters\u201d. \u201cThe average North American population consumes insufficient quantities of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and too much Na+.\u201d source nbci Again, the problem of taste preferences and the unwillingness to spend money for better health is prevalent. Another humorous experience I had was when I would sometimes end up at a fast food restaurant. I typically don\u2019t drink soda, so I always ask for water. My first experience was funny because I had a hard time finding a water dispenser. It was usually located with the Sprite dispenser, and I had to push a hidden button under the Sprite logo to obtain the water. I was discouraged and upset the first time I encountered this, because the button didn\u2019t work properly and I had a difficult time getting my desired water. #obesity #Health #empires #UnitedStates #Rome\u201cGive them bread and circuses and they will never revolt.\u201d",

The purpose of Satoshi is to empower the individual by giving them responsibility. Decentralization means that everyone bears responsibility. A community where everyone is responsible is a strong society, as every element is strong and knowledgeable enough to hold the leadership accountable through exit options, which brings dynamism to the system. This must happen before the leadership becomes entrenched and causes harmful consequences for the network elements, leading to the inefficiency of the entire system. Every time a system fails, it is due to an overcomplicated set of rules that makes it difficult to determine who bears responsibility. The contract becomes a trust agreement between a smart agent and a group of ignorant parties.

He played a key role in the transformation of Singapore from a British colony into a prosperous, modern city-state. Lee Kuan Yew was born in Singapore and studied law at Cambridge University in England. In 1954, he founded the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) and began campaigning for self-government for Singapore. In 1959, the PAP won the general election and Lee became the first Prime Minister of Singapore, leading the country to independence from Malaysia in 1965.

He established a meritocratic system of government, which valued education and talent, and promoted Singapore as a centre for trade and finance. Under Lee\u2019s leadership, Singapore became one of the most prosperous and successful countries in Asia, with a high standard of living, a strong economy, and a reputation for efficiency and cleanliness. However, his policies also drew criticism for their authoritarianism and restrictions on civil liberties. After stepping down as Prime Minister in 1990, Lee remained active in politics and continued to influence Singaporean society until his death in 2015. He is widely regarded as a founding father of modern Singapore and a respected statesman and leader in the region. Lee Kuan Yew achieved a remarkable level of success in Singapore, as evidenced by the country\u2019s per capita income growth over two generations. In the early days of his leadership, per capita income was around $400, but through his policies and programs, Singapore\u2019s economy grew significantly, and now, after only a few decades, per capita income has risen to over $50,000, demonstrating the magnitude of the economic transformation that took place under his leadership. \u201cWhat would Lee Kuan Yew do?

He played a key role in the transformation of Singapore from a British colony into a prosperous, modern city-state. Lee Kuan Yew was born in Singapore and studied law at Cambridge University in England. In 1954, he founded the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) and began campaigning for self-government for Singapore. In 1959, the PAP won the general election and Lee became the first Prime Minister of Singapore, leading the country to independence from Malaysia in 1965. As Prime Minister, Lee implemented policies that emphasized economic growth, social order, and racial harmony. He established a meritocratic system of government, which valued education and talent, and promoted Singapore as a centre for trade and finance. Under Lee\u2019s leadership, Singapore became one of the most prosperous and successful countries in Asia, with a high standard of living, a strong economy, and a reputation for efficiency and cleanliness. However, his policies also drew criticism for their authoritarianism and restrictions on civil liberties. After stepping down as Prime Minister in 1990, Lee remained active in politics and continued to influence Singaporean society until his death in 2015. He is widely regarded as a founding father of modern Singapore and a respected statesman and leader in the region. Lee Kuan Yew achieved a remarkable level of success in Singapore, as evidenced by the country\u2019s per capita income growth over two generations. In the early days of his leadership, per capita income was around $400, but through his policies and programs, Singapore\u2019s economy grew significantly, and now, after only a few decades, per capita income has risen to over $50,000, demonstrating the magnitude of the economic transformation that took place under his leadership. \u201cWhat would Lee Kuan Yew do?

Additionally, it is important to create a sense of belonging and connection within the community, so that everyone feels like they are part of something larger than themselves.

Define the risks of managing a community and how mitigate them: The risks of managing a community include the potential for conflict between members, the potential for members to become disengaged or uninterested, and the potential for members to become overwhelmed by the amount of work or responsibility. To mitigate these risks, it is important to ensure that the community is well-structured and organized, that members are given clear roles and responsibilities, and that there is a system in place to address any conflicts that arise. Additionally, it is important to provide members with resources and support to help them stay engaged and motivated, and to ensure that the workload is manageable. What are the qualities of a good citizen A good citizen is someone who is productive, strives for excellence, and is motivated to make a positive impact on their community. They should be willing to work hard to improve their own life and the lives of those around them. They should also be respectful of the law and customs of their community, and be willing to help others in need. Finally, they should be committed to making the world a better place for everyone.

The West must ensure that our citizens are connected to the earth, that they have a sense of belonging and that they are willing to help each other in times of need. We must foster a sense of community and family, so that our citizens are not only connected to each other, but also to the nation as whole. (Here things are going wrong) We must also ensure that our citizens have access to the resources they need to succeed. We must provide them with the education and skills they need to thrive, and we must create an environment where they can pursue their dreams and reach their full potential.

How can we achieve cohesion and alignment within a community? Cohesion and alignment within a community can be achieved by creating a shared set of values and goals that everyone can strive towards. This could include emphasizing the importance of hard work, excellence and productivity, as well as the importance of providing a better future for the next generation. Additionally, it is important to create a sense of belonging and connection within the community, so that everyone feels like they are part of something larger than themselves. This could be done through activities such as community service, shared meals, or other activities that bring people together. Define the risks of managing a community and how mitigate them: The risks of managing a community include the potential for conflict between members, the potential for members to become disengaged or uninterested, and the potential for members to become overwhelmed by the amount of work or responsibility. To mitigate these risks, it is important to ensure that the community is well-structured and organized, that members are given clear roles and responsibilities, and that there is a system in place to address any conflicts that arise. Additionally, it is important to provide members with resources and support to help them stay engaged and motivated, and to ensure that the workload is manageable. What are the qualities of a good citizen A good citizen is someone who is productive, strives for excellence, and is motivated to make a positive impact on their community. They should be willing to work hard to improve their own life and the lives of those around them. They should also be respectful of the law and customs of their community, and be willing to help others in need. Finally, they should be committed to making the world a better place for everyone.

Eat less, eat qualitative Email Address But let\u2019s start with the basics Fig. 3 Charles Darwin When I think about humans my memory recalls some stuff about the evolution of our species. Yes, we are what we are today because of a series of improvements obtained thanks to some biological adaptations, mainly caused by genes but not only. It seems indeed that the best tool we have gained through evolutionary processes is mainly the consequence of our ability to handle food, our cerebral cortex growth was exponential when we discovered how to cook and conserve food, this gives us regularity in our meals and the ability to feed ourselves in tranches of more digestible food instead of having irregular big meals of raw food. Fire gives us the opportunity to delegate part of the digestive process to the fire\u2019s energy; indeed fire makes the digestive process less energy demanding, increasing the absorption of nutrients, unlocking these excess energy to cognitive processes. \u201cMechanisms contributing to energy being gained from cooking include increased digestibility of starch and protein, reduced costs of digestion for cooked versus raw meat, and reduced energetic costs of detoxification and defence against pathogens.\u201d pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Fig 3. Humans evolution trajectory (not necessarily suggesting causation but undoubtedly, something happens or probably a series of events.)

Ok Dave but this shit is tasty! Our perception of good or bad, beauty or ugliness, good taste or bad taste is highly dependent on our culture. If you grow up in an environment where sauces, sugars drinks, and low quality beef between two pieces of low quality bread are highly advertised, all your friends eat Mcdonalds too, and therefore most of your childhood memories are tied to a Fast Food, you will probably associate fast food as one your best experiences. Having a healthy lifestyle requires effort and the willingness to recalibrate our taste buds, in other words align our concept of tasty with the brick of a healthy diet. Most of us are addicted to sensory perceptions, like for example the sweet taste which does not exist in a natural environment but the industry energizing in order to enslave us to inexistent taste, investing the money distorting our short term brain sensations at the expense of the nutritional contents for long term health consequences. This quote by David Deutsch in my opinion is perfectly applicable also to taste, because taste is a form of beauty, a sensorial feeling of something good. \u201cCould it be purely cultural? We pursue beauty as well as truth, and in both cases we can be fooled.

Mental performance and emotional stability. Even if I started primarily focusing on physical performance, I reach the conclusion that the main goal of a diet is mental performance. Qualitative food, exercises and fasting are part of a progress through the enhancement of our ability to absorb more information, connect more dots and become more creative. Our brain is an organic CPU and through a multidisciplinary approach we can learn how to gain some horsepower and reduce the noise. The body itself is the litmus paper of our progress and not a final goal, It shows us if we are going in the right direction. If we are doing the right thing our body becomes aesthetically more pleasing, but don\u2019t confuse the aspect with the meaning, the risk is to end up using shortcuts such as for example roids. \u201cYour duty is to stand straight, not held straight\u201d Marcus Aurelius Over time I abandoned the idea of practicing competitive sport, since I noticed that competitiveness tends to bring people to sacrifice their health for their performance.

Because in nature finding a high energetical source of food is a business which requires determination and tenacity, there is an equilibrium between energy delivered and conquered energy. An incorrectly calibrated reward system can bring us into depression and anxiety, evolution sets us to be rewarded when we accomplish something great for our tribe, not because we pay to feel rewarded, that creates tons of trouble along the way. Then when you will reduce your sugar intake brace yourself for the classical withdrawal symptoms, or maybe you will go in denial mode and you will deny your addiction. \u201cIf a dietary approach to treating psychotic symptoms was suggested, what might this regime look like? Glycemic index (GI) describes the rate of absorption of glucose from carbohydrate. High GI carbohydrate foods, such as white bread, sugar and refined cereals, cause a \u2018spike\u2019 in insulin and blood glucose (followed by a dip). Low GI carbohydrate foods, such as wholegrain bread and most vegetables (or foods containing little carbohydrate at all, such as nuts, seeds and meat), produce a slower insulin response and thus a more steady supply of glucose to the blood. Low GI diets induce weight loss and improve blood glucose control in people with diabetes. A recent meta-analysis showed that people following a low GI diet had more weight loss than other diets [48]. \u201c\u2026\u201cStudies of the effects of low glycaemic index diets on dopamine release are yet to be carried out, however anecdotal reports suggest an initial discomfort and craving after starting this regime, which suggests a component of withdrawal.\u201d\u2026\u201cThe common link drawn between eating, psychosis and mid-brain dopaminergic reward, logically, suggests that psychosis may be improved, by modifying carbohydrate consumption. \u201c ncbi.nlm.nih.gov That said I want to reiterate and highlight my goal: Enhance my cognitive performance, enhance my physical performance, live longer in",

What I immediately understand is the importance of testosterone and growth hormone e their response to various type of food: Testosterone This hormone is incredibly important for the body composition but not only, it is also for our mind giving you more energy and more focus, it seems also that it positively affects memory. Optimizing its productions seems like a good idea. It seems again that the foods we introduce in our body mainly affects our cognitive skills. A part of our testosterone is converted into estradiol (an estrogen steroid hormone, the major female sex hormone) by a process called aromatase. Body fat levels increase the amount of testosterone converted, and therefore if our goal is to optimize the production of these hormones, then a low level of body fat is required. On the other hand though, as our body uses fat to metabolize testosterone, then it is important to have a balanced amount of fat in our diet, removing fats from our diets is a common mistake in this sense. Growth Hormone There is a connection between growth hormones and sugar, it seems indeed that in a hypoglycemic state our body produces an exponential quantity of HGH, the role of HGH is to maintain a healthy body composition and preserve muscle mass. \u201cthe mean GH response was significantly diminished when the men received glucose (8.12 \u00b1 1.12 ng/ml) compared to that when they received only water (23.70 \u00b1 8.46 ng/ml; P < 0.01).

If we want a strong society, the current path followed by a good portion of the western population is a recipe for disaster. \u201cConsumption of rewards (e.g., palatable food, mating, cocaine) produces hedonic consequences which initiate learning processes that consolidate liking the rewarding goal. Motivational states such as hunger, sexual arousal, and perhaps early symptoms of drug withdrawal increase the incentive salience of reward-related cues and the reward itself. The greater the hunger, the greater the likelihood that behavioral sequences aimed at obtaining food will be initiated and carried to conclusion despite distractions and obstacles that may arise. \u201c ncbi.nlm.nih.gov mTOR \u201cAccordingly, mTOR",

        "text": "the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate",

        "text": "They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment",

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales.

Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d William N.

More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond. From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we",

Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins.

How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the",

        "text": "Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset,",

Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition.

The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain.

Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between",

ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d William N.

If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond.

        "text": "valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the",

How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield.

Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock.

Remember that, every industry is different and there are different metrics to focus on, anyway I am trying to summarize the most important factor in the future. I will revisit my analysis of statements with a more granular focus. To be honest, I consider the income statements the least useful of all statements. It\u2019s useful in order to interpret Cash Flow, for example an healthy cash generation depends on increased profits, thanks to income statements we can see the past sales trend. In the Cash flow statement we will see how these sales are converted into real cash. Balance sheet, that is the second statement we will discover! Stay tuned!

In the holy bible Noah was a God\u2019s prophet, in his days the God warned Noah about the advent of a catastrophic flooding, and he ordered him to build a boat in order to survive. God gives to Noah the technical specificity of the ark. Time passes but there is always an upcoming apocalypse to worry about, it is the cyclical nature of our universe. If we invest for the long run, our boat has to survive financial floods and storms, in other words: bubbles and bust (Article Stock Market Crash).

Facebook 2020 Balance Sheet source: Edgar Foundation. The balance sheet shows what a company owns and owes, and how much shareholders have invested in. The formula: Assets = Liabilities + Equity Fig 3. Formula This is the basic formula of the balance sheet equilibrium, and it is the alloy that makes up the hull of our boat. Assets Anything of value, which has a cash value and/or generates cash, i.e.: cash, buildings, infrastractures,.. A few examples: Company = farm\u2019s truck: utilized to grow oats which once sold generate cash. Individual = house: rented for income Note: Usually, if inflation goes up, the value of assets already in place go up compared to the book value (replacement cost). Liabilities Something (i.e., assets) owed to somebody else. An example: Every sort of debt, often used to finances the acquisition of an assets, which will generate cash to repaid the debt interest, and generate additional income (e.g., mortgage) Here we can note the importance of producing more earnings than the cost of the obligation (interest rate) aka Return On Capital employed. If not, the company is burning cash. In other words, if I assume a debt of 100 and I have to pay an 1% interest, and I use this money to develop a project which returns < 1%, we are paying more, respect to our return, that is called Value Destruction.

Even if the company manages to service its debt, this payment decreases the cash flow available to pay shareholders. When a company downsizes its debt burden, it releases money for shareholders: dividends, repurchases and investments. Remember: the true nature of investing regards the money the company pays us, not the price set by Mr. Market. (article 8. Mr Market) Equity Simply put, this is your piece of the cake. What amount of money, hypothetically, would be returned to you as an owner if the company would be liquidated. Equity can also be called book value. For some sectors or businesses, book value per share can be a useful metric (notoriously in the past Warren Buffett buybacks $BRK stock under 1.2 times book value, as a sort of proxy to define the intrinsic value, indeed a smooth growth in equity could be a good sign). Example: individual = Equity is what belongs to you after you deduct the mortgage of your house from the total value, that\u2019s the Equity of your home. It is composed by two essential parts: Original investment and later investment Retaining earnings: is the percentage of profit that was not paid as dividend/buybacks, accumulated overtime and can be reinvested for new projects and acquisition or used to pay off debt. As usual there is not a magic formula. However, in the example of the previous article, the best companies don\u2019t need external fuel, but those companies use their profit as fuel. In other words they are self-financed. Another example: Alibaba uses e-commerce main business as a fuel generator for AliCloud and Venture Capitalist investment not yet profitable. You can see the potential of a business that has excess cash to deploy in a series of new projects, even in uncharted and risky territory.

BVPS = Shareholders equity / number of shares. Now it is clear why the Balance sheets are useful and important, because they define what we own, as investors. Intangible Something forgotten by accounting is the importance of intangible assets, namely the money spent by the company in order to develop new technologies (Research & Development R&D) for developing a brand (Sales, General and Administrative SG&A), for training specialized labor forces (COGS) or create a new intellectual property. These items are not capitalized (transformed into an asset then depreciated overtime), but those intangibles have a long term value, mostly in our tech oriented society. In other words, this money spent will generate real assets, even if they are not represented in the balance sheet, rather those intangible assets are treated as cost and immediate expense. Brand, franchising, trained labor, intellectual property, customer lists, reputation, culture, loyal employees, data, those are only some examples which share some of the features of physical assets, and they can generate cash flow over time. Mickey Mouse could be a good example. Mickey was the creation of two brilliant minds, Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. These two guys have spent energy in order to draw and develop this character, in the form of time, money and brain power. This energy has been converted into one of the most notorious and valuable fictional characters of all time, imagine how much money $DIS extrapolate from this creative work (e.g., comics, books, parks, merchandising,\u2026). \u201cin 1966 people said \u201cWell, Mary Poppins is terrific this year, but they [Disney] are not going to have",

Intellectual properties could be an eternal money mine with the difference that a mine needs physical infrastructures which in turns needs maintenance, Mickey not. Furthermore nobody else can own a Mickey Mouse. What does this mean? In an inflationary environment, your maintenance/replacements costs are going to increase, reducing the profit margin, that doesn\u2019t happen with IP (intellectual property). Other than that, its life expectancy is sustained by its current age, as it is the case for Mickey (Lindy effect). Then rather than depreciate, often intangibles gain value proportionally to their age, the passage of time crystallizes the brand recognition in the customers minds, namely mindshare, a notion already discussed in the past article.

These are assets owned by the company that are cash or can be converted into cash immediately (e.g., marketable security). How much cash is it good to have? As usual there is not a unique answer, but from what I saw, it\u2019s always a good thing. Mostly during prosperity periods, to accumulate some cash. That is because when a storm arrives, cash gives us fuel to weather the storm, and other than that, if our CEO is a great capital allocator, he will take advantage of the crisis acquiring assets at a discount and consequently with a high Return on Investment (ROI). Even a great company will suffer damage during a storm, the goal is survive and thrive in the post flood environment.

Warning: an inventory turnover too high can mean that the company does not have sufficient inventory to cover the demands. \u201cExamples abound of how considerable increases in inventory and/or accounts receivable can forecast downward earnings and surprises. This is especially true in those industries subject to rapid changes in products and taste. Expect to find them in companies dealing with high fashion, seasonal goods, and especially high tech. No investor seriously involved with stocks in these industries can afford to ignore accounts receivable and inventories.\u201d Thorton L. O\u2019Glove, Quality of Earnings Deferred tax assets This asset is usually created when a business incurs a loss in a financial year (NOL: Net Operating Loss) or a company overpaid or paid in advance taxes. It can be carried over indefinitely and can be used to reduce future tax liability. Non-current assets Noncurrent assets are assets tangible or intangible that will benefit the company for more than one year. PP&E, long term investment, goodwill. Gross Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) Tangible long term assets also known as Fixed Assets: machinery, computers, office equipment, vehicles, furniture, buildings, lands. Accumulated depreciation As explained in the last article (15.

Net PP&E The results from the depreciation of our assets over time. Gross PP&E \u2013 Accumulated depreciation. In other words, the remaining accounting value of our physical assets.

Suppose the property cost $20 million originally. Would you say it was worth only $5 million after fifteen years? That is what the company\u2019s books would indicate, but given the nature of the real estate market, that building might fetch $30 million or more.

A \u201cgoodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not.\u201d The balance sheet represents the present value of this intangible asset netted by impairments. A warning sign could be a high percentage of goodwill over assets, it\u2019s worth digging on the capital allocation ability of the CEO. For example, if a company pays $1 mio to buy another company that has net assets of $500k, they are going to have $500k of goodwill on their balance sheet. The net assets that they have acquired for $500k cost to them more than if they are to buy the business components separately. If it turns out that the whole acquired company doesn\u2019t generate the expected Cash Flow over time, they would need to start impairing the goodwill asset. If a company keeps acquiring assets or entire companies and later they regularly charge",

Liabilities Current liabilities Short term financial obligations that are due in the next 12 months, including account payable, deferred revenue, short term debt, dividends, notes payable, taxes owed. Account Payable Account payables (AP) are amounts due to suppliers for services or goods received, but not yet paid. It is a sort of short term loan, indeed lengthening the payment time is a source of cash for the company. AP are the liabilities counterpart of the AR (Account Receivables), previously analyzed. Deferred/unearned revenue Advance payments: a company received service/products not yet delivered. Not represented in the income until service/product will be delivered, but it will be shown in the cash flow statement when cash is received. Revenue recognition means that the revenue can only be recognized when the revenue process is complete, payment has been made and the good/service has been delivered. A common example could be a subscription-based product or services that require prepayments. Short term borrowing Financial obligations that are expected to be paid within a year. Non current liabilities Financial obligations that are not due within the upcoming year, long term debt and leases. Long term debt Debts are not necessarily bad, but could become a big problem. Debt is useful and its scope is to generate wealth in our society. A good starting point in order to understand the role of debt is a video made by Ray Dalio (How economic machine works). However, debt is a social problem. When an individual, a business or a society brings more debt than is productive output, there could be a problem (unless you are the reserve currency printer, namely US, but this is another story \u2013 Lyn Alden Petrodollar).

        "text": "having some debt, could be a good idea, but only if that more money is used to generate wealth in the long term. For example, having a huge pile of debts and paying high dividends to the shareholders may seem a good idea, but in reality is the sign of a myopic management with a short term vision. High level of debt means high level of interest to pay, this interest will reduce the cash our business can pay to us as owners, moreover this debt burden must be rapaid sooner or later, reducing future cash generation. Some companies rather than lower their dividend and lose their investors, those companies use debt to payout dividends, that increases debt services and reduces the future gain. In other words, it is the action of a short-sighted management and it will be detrimental for long term shareholders. It is useful to compare cash and long term debt in order to understand how much net debt the company has. Why do some companies have cash and debt? There are many reasons. The first reason is the tax advantage. Another reason worth noting is that some companies are international, then they have assets in foreign currency exposed to local devaluation risks to compensate for this devaluation the company takes a debt in the same currency, in order to take advantage of local currency devaluation without trapping money in countries with weak currency. Leases Lease is a contract between two parties, where the lessee pays the lessors for an asset use. Be careful, capital leases are counted as liabilities. A new FASB rule, effective Dec. 15, 2018, requires that all leases unless they are shorter than 12 months must be recognized on the balance sheet. Number of common stock We have already discussed the notion of share repurchases (how companies reward us). I want to highlight an aspect, companies not only repurchase shares, but sometimes they issue new fresh stocks, having the opposite effect: namely diluting the stocks count thus devaluing the value of a single stock. You can think that: stocks are like money, a store of value. Companies can pay investors, employees or even what they need with stocks. We, as investors",

Nothing wrong about it, if employees and management are themselves owners could mean that they act like owners in the interest of us, as investors. This is a complex argument that needs a separate article, but it is worth remembering for the next article where we are going to analyze the cash flow. Other than that it is good to look at the number of share counts over time in order to understand if the company is diluting our earning participation. The management must treat shares as if they are gold bullions, nothing wrong using stock as a currency, but only if the exchange is worth our gold bullions.

Net Working Capital (NWC) The NWC is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. NWC tells us the operational efficiency of the business, in other word the ability to reduce the costs and improve the gain in the short term transaction. If a company has positive working capital, it means that it has the ability to invest money in the business. The goal is to cover operating expenses while using assets in the most productive manner. As usual, one of the most important goals is resource optimization. NWC = Current Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities A negative working capital suggests there will be trouble to pay the short term debts.

Company life stages source: Prof Aswath Damodaran The table on fig. 8 by Prof Aswath Damoradan is useful to contextualize the figures, every stage of the life of the company has its optimal blend of assets/debt/equity. Return on Equity (ROE) ROE measures the financial performance and corporate profitability of assets owned by investors. It is useful to define the ability of the management to make profit with our money. It defines how much profit is generated for each shareholder dollar. Earnings growth can never exceed ROE. Be careful, a high ROE is not a guarantee of growth. ROE = Net income / average shareholders\u2019 equity \u201cFocus on Return on Equity, not earnings per share\u201d Warren Buffett Be wary, in order to understand the results we have to know the capital structure. Basically, if equity is the result of Assets \u2013 liabilities, the more liabilities we have the higher is the ROE. Keep in mind, there is not a magic formula, but we need a holistic approach. Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Similar to ROE but with a different denominator, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is used to evaluate the capital allocation ability on total available capital. ROA = Net income /Total assets ROIC = Net income / (Debt + Equity) ROIC > Cost Of Capital = Value Creation ROIC < Cost Of Capital = Value Destruction The deal is finding a business which produces a high ROIC, and it can deploy all its earned cash at the same high ROIC, this would be a legendary business.

Even if you pay a high price, over the long term if you buy a great company with a high return on capital your Total Shareholder Return (TSR) will be good.

Past data are useful to understand the management ability, but they are not certainties for future returns. \u201cIn the business world, unfortunately, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the windshield.\u201d Warren Buffett This means two things: The art of investing is the ability to use past numbers and stories to help us to hypothesize the existence of a MOAT, and the ability of the management to defend and improve this MOAT over time. That is the secret to maintaining the past performances. We, as investors, use this data and our future outlook to choose the investment with the best probabilistic chance to realize a gain. For that reason I\u2019m obsessed with the idea of finding companies with a wide competitive advantage. The past uses of capital is a responsibility of the management and condition of the past. It is entirely possible that the recent Capital Allocation has become better or worse, but our metrics pay the price of past weak decisions (e.g., if management in the past overpay for an asset, this excess can weigh on the balance sheet). Ideally, we want to assess the present capital allocation decision, but almost always, we have the data of the entire asset\u2019s story of the business, and we can\u2019t assess the Return of Capital for every single project.

Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross?",

        "text": "When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales).

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles.

If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales.

R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war).

Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers.

That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested.

EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable.

Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value.

Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign.

In this manner, we can track the number history of the company, and glimpse the evolution over time. In other words, it defines if the company is in healthy condition, and if it is growing overtime. It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that",

If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great",

Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product",

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years.

Thorndike, The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success Finally, net income must be positive! I remember you, our purpose is to find the best company and don\u2019t lose money. More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond. From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross",

        "text": "[(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase",

The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator.

We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.).

I will revisit my analysis of statements with a more granular focus. To be honest, I consider the income statements the least useful of all statements.

In the Cash flow statement we will see how these sales are converted into real cash. Balance sheet, that is the second statement we will discover! Stay tuned!

It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money?

The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price,",

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin. There are tons of numbers and metrics useful, but we have only one brain, so the best thing to do is try to cut down our cognitive load. \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Albert Einstein That\u2019s my goal with this blog. Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services.

Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d William N.

More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond. From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we",

Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the",

        "text": "Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill.

Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign.

Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L).

The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can",

Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles.

The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?).

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders.

        "text": "valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins.

How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield.

It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign.

Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money?

As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a",

Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements.

A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin.

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs.

I remember you, our purpose is to find the best company and don\u2019t lose money. More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond.

Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied",

        "text": "include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the",

Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.).

In the Cash flow statement we will see how these sales are converted into real cash. Balance sheet, that is the second statement we will discover! Stay tuned!

These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money?

Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business.

Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin. There are tons of numbers and metrics useful, but we have only one brain, so the best thing to do is try to cut down our cognitive load. \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Albert Einstein That\u2019s my goal with this blog. Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find",

As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d William N.

That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS",

        "text": "Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a",

But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not.

It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses.

        "text": "and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product",

If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?).

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers.

If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond.

What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define",

In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s",

Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.).

Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs).

        "text": "Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price",

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales.

R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it",

Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers.

If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond.

The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames.

Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested.

Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you",

From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time.

Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock.

It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is",

Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high",

Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles.

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years.

ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs.

When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d William N.

If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond.

The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this",

The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative!

It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand",

Remember that, every industry is different and there are different metrics to focus on, anyway I am trying to summarize the most important factor in the future. I will revisit my analysis of statements with a more granular focus. To be honest, I consider the income statements the least useful of all statements.

Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient.

Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis",

Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing.

To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin. There are tons of numbers and metrics useful, but we have only one brain, so the best thing to do is try to cut down our cognitive load. \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Albert Einstein That\u2019s my goal with this blog.

R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other",

Thorndike, The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success Finally, net income must be positive! I remember you, our purpose is to find the best company and don\u2019t lose money. More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond. From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to",

Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1",

It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The",

Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.).

Our aim is to become practitioner investors, not employees of an accounting firm. My goal is to distill the meaningful parts of the process, in order to craft our thesis in a simple manner without too much noise (First principle thinking, remember, when we will talk about Mental models).

In this manner, we can track the number history of the company, and glimpse the evolution over time. In other words, it defines if the company is in healthy condition, and if it is growing overtime. It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset.

These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company.",

(Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles.

R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war).

Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs.

Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It",

It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to",

If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad",

In this manner, we can track the number history of the company, and glimpse the evolution over time. In other words, it defines if the company is in healthy condition, and if it is growing overtime. It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work",

The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side.

If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales).

Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?).

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years.

From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing",

        "text": "profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner.",

        "text": "then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these",

It is usually developed through marketing and can be seen in the form of a strong brand, such as Apple.

Research and Development (R&D) is also important for companies to remain competitive and introduce new products and services. Net income is the bottom line on the income statement and represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A) tells us the costs incurred managing the company and it is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue.

        "text": "instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.). Time will judge if you made a good choice. It\u2019s always about the allocation of capital. \u201cIf you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings \u2014 assuming the company in question has earnings.

Remember that, every industry is different and there are different metrics to focus on, anyway I am trying to summarize the most important factor in the future. I will revisit my analysis of statements with a more granular focus. To be honest, I consider the income statements the least useful of all statements.

In the Cash flow statement we will see how these sales are converted into real cash. Balance sheet, that is the second statement we will discover! Stay tuned!

Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses.

For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded.

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles.

To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin.

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war).

Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers.

Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs.

From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested.

        "text": "what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the",

Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time.

Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign.

Why is it so hard to be a contrarian? Because animals in the middle of the herd tend to behave like the other members of the herd, mostly when there is an upcoming threat and little time to think what to do.Under pressure and in the middle of uncertainty we will follow the herd because we believe it\u2019s safer to stay with the crowd.

        "text": "to say: I\u2019m a Value Investor or at least is what I aim to be.I\u2019m sure a lot of you are wondering about what means to be a Value Investor.To be a Value Investor is counterintuitive because it isn\u2019t in the nature of human beings to behave like a Value Investor.It\u2019s precisely for that reason that it is the right path to follow. Do you remember? In the last article (8. Mr. Market) I spoke about the contrarian attitude of a good investor.It\u2019s very hard to be a contrarian because humans like animals are subjected to herd bias. Why is it so hard to be a contrarian? Because animals in the middle of the herd tend to behave like the other members of the herd, mostly when there is an upcoming threat and little time to think what to do.Under pressure and in the middle of uncertainty we will follow the herd because we believe it\u2019s safer to stay with the crowd. I would say that most of the time this is true, but sometimes the herd reacts in an emotional way through a self-reinforced pattern, because every member follows the next fellow and that generates a chain reaction (bubble, in the case of the stock market. Remember GoPro chart?)Today is a hard time for value investors. With a lot of money flooded in the system, whenever you put your money you will see your capital gain, but untilwhen? Remember, the economy follows cycles, and the winner it\u2019s who is willing to stick with a different path for the long term, it\u2019s who will cope with the entire cycle. Fig 2. Economic Cycles source: Ray Dalio \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked.\u201d Warren Buffett How can we navigate the financial sea in any weather?Simple enough, we must be value investors and behave like a business owner. Like a good captain, we have to choose a great boat with a powerful engine, energy efficiency, and without holes in the shell. But because we don\u2019t have infinite capital, we have to buy at the right price!What",

As I explained in the preceding chapters, businesses use the stock market to finance their activities.Basically there are two ways that companies use for financing themselves: debt and equity.My blog focuses on equity holders or also called shareholders.As shareholders we own a piece of business, while debt holders (bondholders) finance the companies through credits.Usually bondholders, because they are not owners, they are the first allowed to claim their money if the company goes bankrupt. There is a sort of hierarchy of claim where the shareholders are the last allowed to claim their part of the company\u2019s wealth after default.This mechanic put the shareholders in a risky position but even gives us the probability of a better gain.Bondholder return is given and limited while return for shareholders is potentially unlimited.But don\u2019t worry, that risk can be managed and I will explain to you",

Namely find where to put money in order to obtain the maximum return on capital. Returns are essentially divided in 3 main ways: Dividends Buybacks Retained earnings Dividends The most simple and direct method that companies use to share their profits with investors. Dividends are a percentage of the total amount of the capital invested that is pay back monthly or yearly.For example Coke Company pays a dividend of 1.64 USD for every share that in this moment worth approximately 46 USD per share (08 august 2020), this dividend is 3.4% of the total capital you had invested in. Usually this dividend is destined to grow over time. Fig 2. Coke dividend growth Buybacks Another option to share profit is through stocks buybacks.Company buys its own shares in order to reduce the number of circulating shares, doing so investors gain thanks to the rise in percentage owned by the company.For example: if I had a company that was worth 100b and I divided this company into 100 pieces (stocks), every investor owns 1/100 of the company and therefore 1/100 of the profit. But what happens if I remove 10 pieces of this company shares? Now the remaining investors own 1/90 of the company or in other words a bigger piece of the pie.A good management buys back stocks when the market price is below the intrinsic value. What is intrinsic value? I will explain in future articles. Summing up, intrinsic value or fair value, it is the value of the firm based on its intrinsic characteristics.

As I explained in the preceding chapters, businesses use the stock market to finance their activities.Basically there are two ways that companies use for financing themselves: debt and equity.My blog focuses on equity holders or also called shareholders.As shareholders we own a piece of business, while debt holders (bondholders) finance the companies through credits.Usually bondholders, because they are not owners, they are the first allowed to claim their money if the company goes bankrupt.

There is a sort of hierarchy of claim where the shareholders are the last allowed to claim their part of the company\u2019s wealth after default.This mechanic put the shareholders in a risky position but even gives us the probability of a better gain.Bondholder return is given and limited while return for shareholders is potentially unlimited.But don\u2019t worry, that risk can be managed and I will explain to you how to do it in future articles.Our objective is to find good companies that pay us back as much as possible.This idea is called \u201cCapital allocation\u201d. Namely find where to put money in order to obtain the maximum return on capital. Returns are essentially divided in 3 main ways: Dividends Buybacks Retained earnings Dividends The most simple and direct method that companies use to share their profits with investors. Dividends are a percentage of the total amount of the capital invested that is pay back monthly or yearly.For example Coke Company pays a dividend of 1.64 USD for every share that in this moment worth approximately 46 USD per share (08 august 2020), this dividend is 3.4% of the total capital you had invested in. Usually this dividend is destined to grow over time. Fig 2. Coke dividend growth Buybacks Another option to share profit is through stocks buybacks.Company buys its own shares in order to reduce the number of circulating shares, doing so investors gain thanks to the rise in percentage owned by the company.For example: if I had a company that was worth 100b and I divided this company into 100 pieces (stocks), every investor owns 1/100 of the company and therefore 1/100 of the profit. But what happens if I remove 10 pieces of this company shares? Now the remaining investors own 1/90 of the company or in other words a bigger piece of the pie.A good management buys back stocks when the market price is below the intrinsic value. What is intrinsic value? I will explain in future articles. Summing up, intrinsic value or fair value, it is the value of the firm based on its intrinsic characteristics.",

It outlines 10 principles for investing in stocks, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, prioritizing long-term policies, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It emphasizes the importance of looking at multiple years of financial data in order to track the company's evolution over time, and suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data. It also suggests using the official SEC (US Security and Exchange Commission) website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. It highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income, as this indicates that the management has done its job well and that the future direction of the company is likely to be positive.

These companies together make the basement of the country productivity.Because the world follows a growing path in terms of circulating money, number of citizens and consequently numbers of products and services, if we add up the value of all the national company or from a specific sector, and we buy a piece of that collection, over time we will gain thanks to the growth of the worldwide Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Fig. 1 source Federal Reserve As you can see in the US the circulating money is growing and that money goes into the pockets of those who invest. For example, I often heard people complaining about riches.

S&P500 is only an example, there is plenty of index for every nation or sector. Exchange Traded Fund Today we have specific financial instruments that mimic the trend of the various indexes. This instrument is called Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). ETFs are exchange like stocks and the main issuer of this instrument are Vanguard or iShare.An example is SPY, if you have a bank account you can ask your consultant about this option.

These companies together make the basement of the country productivity.Because the world follows a growing path in terms of circulating money, number of citizens and consequently numbers of products and services, if we add up the value of all the national company or from a specific sector, and we buy a piece of that collection, over time we will gain thanks to the growth of the worldwide Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Fig. 1 source Federal Reserve As you can see in the US the circulating money is growing and that money goes into the pockets of those who invest. For example, I often heard people complaining about riches. The difference between poor and rich is that the riches take assets through the investing practice, while poors take liabilities because they spend all their income for short-term futile purpose. With passive investing method you can buy through a fund a piece of a sector, a country or even the entire world and partecipate in the wealth growing. An example is S&P500. Fig. 2 source Wikipedia This is a bouquet of the 500 largest US companies, in finance this instrument is called \u201can index\u201d, specifically in this case is called Index Fund. For the 10 years ending December 31st 2019, had an annual compounded rate of return",

Fig. 3 Compound interest on last 10 years of S&P500 on a initial investment of 10000 USD to 34000 USD As you can see in the long run the growth of the Index follows the path of the growth of the circulating money. S&P500 is only an example, there is plenty of index for every nation or sector. Exchange Traded Fund Today we have specific financial instruments that mimic the trend of the various indexes. This instrument is called Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). ETFs are exchange like stocks and the main issuer of this instrument are Vanguard or iShare.An example is SPY, if you have a bank account you can ask your consultant about this option. Fig 4 Main components of S&P500 (SPY) Source Yahoo finance If you follow this path, you don\u2019t have to worry about the soundness of a single company where you invest, because you invest in the entire market. Market is tied to the continuous growth of the economic world, propelled by injection of money by central banks. Fig 5. Returns by Asset Class (1996-2015) source J.P. Morgan As you can see the best choice for the average Joe is to put their savings on a S&P 500 fund.REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) is another financials istrument that I will talk about in the future. Stock picking The second way is the path that I have decided to follow.I never liked to go to the restaurant and order the menu, I prefer choose by myself without intromissions.Furthermore you can earn more money but there is more work to do.For that reason, pick stock will be the main theme of this blog.

It outlines 10 principles for investing in stocks, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, prioritizing long-term policies, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It emphasizes the importance of looking at multiple years of financial data in order to track the company's evolution over time, and suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data. It also suggests using the official SEC (US Security and Exchange Commission) website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income, as this indicates that the management has done its job well and that the future direction of the company is likely to",

It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market.

It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market.

It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking. It also touches on the topics of cryptocurrency,",

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking. It also touches on the topics of cryptocurrency,",

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking.

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking.

        "text": "This article provides an overview of financial analysis and how to use it to identify companies with a durable competitive edge. It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking. It also touches on the topics of cryptocurrency,",

        "text": "In an interview with the great Marcus Aurelius, it was discussed how citizens of the Roman Empire should protect their wealth from being taken away by those in power. It was suggested that they seek out alternative forms of currency that cannot be debased and whose ledgers are public. This will ensure that their wealth is secure and that they are not taken advantage of. Additionally, it was suggested that they strive to be honest and honorable in all their dealings. In the present day, the US Fed plans to reduce its holdings of Treasury and government agency securities by $95bn per month. This will force the Treasury to issue more new debt to make up for the funding shortfall. However, other items such as the $450bn Treasury General Account and the $2.52tn \u201creverse repo\u201d facility for providing short-term investment to parties such as money market funds could drop significantly, offsetting some of the losses. It was also discussed that creativity is inside everyone and that it is important to be open-minded and collaborative in order to solve the life rebus. Finally, it was suggested that speculation can be beneficial if it is done responsibly and with the intention of giving away the money earned.",

It outlines 10 principles for investing, such as investing in health, education, infrastructure and technology, maintaining a competitive edge, and pursuing sustainable development. It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market. It discusses the importance of understanding the psychological hurdles of investing, such as patience, social proof, vividness, and probability-based thinking. It also touches on the topics of cryptocurrency,",

Humans are anti-fragile and when a danger arises, they tend to adapt and become stronger than their environment. This is seen in the decentralization of resources, such as Bitcoin, and the use of fasting and meditation to train the mind and body. Cash is still trash and the winning team in a battle over scarce resources tends to break up into two factions again. AI is driving the business of social media and blockchain is being used in African countries to promote financial inclusion and digital transformation. The Central African Republic is backing their National Digital Currency, SANGO, with Bitcoin, putting Bitcoin in the position of \"digital gold\". It is futile to predict the economy, interest rates and stock market, and knowledge is power to achieve peace of mind. Finally, centralizing the metaverse is a threat to the survival of the species and all evils are due to lack of knowledge.",

It explains the key metrics to look for in a company's financial statements, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, and non-cash expenses. It also suggests using platforms such as quickfs.net or tikr.com to retrieve the data, and the official SEC website EDGAR to find official documents on companies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of pricing power, research and development, net income, selling general and admin expenses, and ratios. Value investing is a contrarian approach to investing that involves buying stocks at a price lower than their intrinsic value. It requires patience and a long-term view, and emphasizes the importance of finding a company with a positive net income. The article also provides a newsletter with financial education, business and sector analysis, and a stoic and calm attitude towards the market.
