Yes, we are what we are today because of a series of improvements obtained thanks to some biological adaptations, mainly caused by genes but not only. It seems indeed that the best tool we have gained through evolutionary processes is mainly the consequence of our ability to handle food, our cerebral cortex growth was exponential when we discovered how to cook and conserve food, this gives us regularity in our meals and the ability to feed ourselves in tranches of more digestible food instead of having irregular big meals of raw food.

Ok Dave but this shit is tasty! Our perception of good or bad, beauty or ugliness, good taste or bad taste is highly dependent on our culture. If you grow up in an environment where sauces, sugars drinks, and low quality beef between two pieces of low quality bread are highly advertised, all your friends eat Mcdonalds too, and therefore most of your childhood memories are tied to a Fast Food, you will probably associate fast food as one your best experiences. Having a healthy lifestyle requires effort and the willingness to recalibrate our taste buds, in other words align our concept of tasty with the brick of a healthy diet. Most of us are addicted to sensory perceptions, like for example the sweet taste which does not exist in a natural environment but the industry energizing in order to enslave us to inexistent taste, investing the money distorting our short term brain sensations at the expense of the nutritional contents for long term health consequences.

A beetle is attracted to another beetle that you and I may see as hideous. But not if you are an entomologist.

What I immediately understand is the importance of testosterone and growth hormone e their response to various type of food: Testosterone This hormone is incredibly important for the body composition but not only, it is also for our mind giving you more energy and more focus, it seems also that it positively affects memory. Optimizing its productions seems like a good idea. It seems again that the foods we introduce in our body mainly affects our cognitive skills. A part of our testosterone is converted into estradiol (an estrogen steroid hormone, the major female sex hormone) by a process called aromatase. Body fat levels increase the amount of testosterone converted, and therefore if our goal is to optimize the production of these hormones, then a low level of body fat is required. On the other hand though, as our body uses fat to metabolize testosterone, then it is important to have a balanced amount of fat in our diet, removing fats from our diets is a common mistake in this sense.

I tend to agree with the last years of the investing practice of Buffett: \u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u201d Warren Buffett This is because at the start of his career Buffett followed the preach of his teacher Graham, which developed his reasoning during the \u201829 crisis, and he was focused on companies discounted in respect of their tangible assets. Sometimes even defined by Graham as \u201ccigar butt\u201d, heavily discounted companies in regard to their tangible assets at the point that the value of the assets itself was greater than the price of the security. Then in a liquidation event (bankruptcy), the investor would have received back the proceeds of the fire sale (only after bondholders). Today, especially in the developed market, we rely on services and technologies which are asset-light businesses. What does the switch from asset heavy to asset light means? Book value (the value of the assets found on the balance sheet) are less valuable in respect to the past. Today we have companies with a high barrier to entry, a powerful brand with mindshare and strong network effects, which produce high profit with less assets.

The logic behind is better explained by a simple example. Imagine you built a lemonade stand near a beautiful beach in some exotic country. As we have seen in the last article a business has some costs related to the activity. Some of this depends directly on the production of the lemon juice (COGS) for example the lemon itself, but even commodities such as the sugar. Then you have to pay the stand where you produce the drink, the land where your activity stands, the machinery to squeeze the lemons. What you will gain depends on how much lemon juice you sell (Revenue), how much you pay to your supplier for the commodities you use in order to manufacture the product (lemon, sugar), how much you will pay to buy/rent the land where your juice factory stands, and how much it will cost to then buy and replace the squeeze machinery (depreciation). In the end, your profit depends if customers come to your stand or to a competitor one. Then, you have to have good marketing to build a brand (mindshare) and good relations with your supplier, maybe thanks to economies of scale, and thus get the lemon for a better price than",

This is a simplified summary of what we had seen until now. \u201cWhy Stocks Go Up and Down\u201d by William H.

It\u2019s a War) For that reason, this blog isn\u2019t just about a simple formula, but the formula we discovered today is only a piece of the grand scheme of things. As explained by Buffett \u201c [\u2026] the formula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by a very smart man in about 600 B.C.

How certain are you that there are indeed birds in the bush? When will they emerge and how many will there be? What is the risk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)? If you can answer these three questions, you will know the maximum value of the bush\u2014 and the maximum number of the birds you now possess that should be offered for it. And, of course, don\u2019t literally think of birds. Think dollars.\u201d Warren Buffett Buffett\u2019s quote implied a series of notion: Time Value of Money = a sum of money in the hand as a greater value than the same sum to be paid in the future.

There are some notorious investors, for example, which they mentally do this calculation or some others which use some shortcut like for example P/E or EV/EBIT. These metrics are named as relative valuation tools, because they are used to compare different investments. Relative valuation looks more simple at glance, the trick is that in these simplified relationships between financial numbers you imply some underlying numbers without clearly expressing them. We will see in the Python code the number of assumptions we have to define in order to obtain the intrinsic value. As we know, the future is inherently uncertain, then every assumption is an error node in our process to reach the range of possible intrinsic value. Mauboussin suggests that given that the stock price is known, we can use a reverse DCF, reversing it to understand what assumptions the market implies in the stock price and if our assumptions are more or less optimistic. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, instead, is part of the tools named Absolute valuation. What\u2019s the difference?

To enjoy this appreciation we have to buy it undervalued and sell it when the price converges with our estimate. How that happens?

Margin of Safety I want to briefly introduce this notion, I will dig into it in a future article, but I feel the need to give you this tool. Now you are ready to look around and search for bargains to buy within your range of fair value. The assumptions used are uncertain therefore the prices are ballpark figures and not precise. For that reason it\u2019s important to understand the notion of Margin of Safety, Seth Klarman wrote a book on it, then I can\u2019t condense the entire idea in a few words, but the basic idea is to buy with a buffer that takes care of uncertainty and errors tied to our calculation. We as investors discount the price to preserve/ protect ourselves from our own ignorance.

This happy outcome would imply a return from purchase price (50 cents) of around 26% per annum. So, what happens when we are wrong? Our most common mistake is to misjudge capital allocation decisions by our companies: firms which articulate a share repurchase/debt repayment strategy and have incentives to reinforce that outcome, throw caution to the wind and make acquisitions instead.

The cash flow statement recognizes the transaction when the money is transferred. This absence of further manipulation, sometimes, defines a more honest picture of the business, for that reason I particularly like this statement, and it\u2019s a good idea to always reason in terms of Cash in and Cash out. Email Address I used the engine allegory to define the income statement, but the real fuel of our company is represented in the Cash flow statement. The energy generation of an engine depends on the efficiency of the system, indeed electric motors are more energy saving, than internal combustion engines (ICE). The latter are also known as heath engines. In thermodynamics, a heat engine is a system that converts heat to mechanical energy, as is the case for the ICE because this engine work by burning fuels to release heat through chemical reactions and eventually producing mechanical thrust. But,what does financial statements have to do with thermodynamics? Because we are going to search for the engine with less energetic dispersion, in other words, the more efficient company. Our money is the fuel and we want the best energetic returns for the fuel we inject. In the Cash Flow statement we can check that efficiency. What are some examples of \u201cenergy dispersion\u201d?

We are going to scan our engine with a thermal visor detecting money dispersion and managerial inefficiency. You can think of companies as a wealth engine, differently from an ICE engine, our engine will compound over time making us rich, in article 7. How companies reward us we already covered this point. The ultimate goal of the free market is efficient capital allocation (long-term efficiency!). Your goal is to rationalize your cognitive process in order to discover efficient allocation, the engine with less energy dispersion, and a modern and efficient electric engine. You are part of the free market engine of this world! You are voting with your feet, in this case with your money! Another thing to consider, is that cash flows are said to be harder to manipulate than earnings, so many investors tell you to just ignore earnings and look at the cash flow statement instead. I usually look first at the income statement, and if it is interesting I dig deeper and take a look at the Cash Flow Statement. Qualitative earnings convert a great portion into cash flows, frauds usually report strong earnings numbers, but generate little cash, it is a red flag.

I leave the Bezos\u2019 explanation: \u201cWith rare exceptions, the volume increase in the short-term is never enough to pay for the price decrease. However, our quantitative understanding of elasticity is short-term. We can estimate what a price reduction will do this week and this quarter. But we cannot numerically estimate the effect that consistently lowering prices will have on our business over five years or ten years. Our judgment is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long-term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.com. We have made similar judgments around Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime, both of which are expensive in the short term and \u2013 we believe \u2013 important and valuable in the long term.\u201d Jeff Bezos Tom Russo, a great investor, define it as \u201cThe capacity to suffer \u201d while describing an amazing business: \u201cWe tend to benefit",

As explained, efficiency and scale are the keys. If you remember, I often cite patience as a virtue of a good investor, this is why it is so important (long term horizon = wealth creation for society and for owners). Fig 9. As explained by Bezos, sacrificing short term free cash flow in favor of sales volume increases the long term gains. The caveat is the ability of the CEO to make the company profitable in the future, not always granted Walmart (WMT) is another good example, it went public in 1970. They generated positive earnings along the way. But they went FCF positive in 1997.

Where, by investing all the cash available, he was able to generate and find future profitable projects, and a huge tailwind (e-commerce/cloud secular trend). Profitability is the key, but it is important remembering that is a by-product of sales growth in the long run. Fig 11. Buffett secret sauce of a winner system Depreciation and Amortization D&A are non-cash expenses, in other words the depreciation of an asset is an accounting figure created to match the expense with the related revenue generated by the contribution of the specific asset. Since the accounting nature of D&A does not really represent the cash influx, as we saw in the FCF section, we add the accounting figure, and we subtract the entire sum when the expense happens (CapEx). Stock based compensation (SBC) OCF added back SBC as a non-cash expense whereas net income subtract it. \u201cBuffett believes that the best boards are composed of relatively small groups (Berkshire has twelve directors) of experienced business people with large ownership stakes.

So far, I have spoken highly about buybacks (Berkshire Hathaway is good example), indeed I think share repurchase is a useful tool in order to reward shareholders, but you have to dig about the balance between share issuances and share repurchase in order to understand if there is a real gain for us, or only an escamotage, adding back SBC to OCF could be a viable alternative. \u201cTo say \u201cStock-Based Compensation\u201d is not an expense is even more cavalier.

For some sectors or businesses, book value per share can be a useful metric (notoriously in the past Warren Buffett buybacks $BRK stock under 1.2 times book value, as a sort of proxy to define the intrinsic value, indeed a smooth growth in equity could be a good sign).

Consequently it is better to have a quick turnover cycle depending on the industry. Inventory turnover: COGS / Average inventory.

In other words, it is the action of a short-sighted management and it will be detrimental for long term shareholders. It is useful to compare cash and long term debt in order to understand how much net debt the company has. Why do some companies have cash and debt? There are many reasons. The first reason is the tax advantage. Another reason worth noting is that some companies are international, then they have assets in foreign currency exposed to local devaluation risks to compensate for this devaluation the company takes a debt in the same currency, in order to take advantage of local currency devaluation without trapping money in countries with weak currency. Leases Lease is a contract between two parties, where the lessee pays the lessors for an asset use. Be careful, capital leases are counted as liabilities.

This is a complex argument that needs a separate article, but it is worth remembering for the next article where we are going to analyze the cash flow. Other than that it is good to look at the number of share counts over time in order to understand if the company is diluting our earning participation.

That is the secret to maintaining the past performances. We, as investors, use this data and our future outlook to choose the investment with the best probabilistic chance to realize a gain. For that reason I\u2019m obsessed with the idea of finding companies with a wide competitive advantage. The past uses of capital is a responsibility of the management and condition of the past. It is entirely possible that the recent Capital Allocation has become better or worse, but our metrics pay the price of past weak decisions (e.g., if management in the past overpay for an asset, this excess can weigh on the balance sheet). Ideally, we want to assess the present capital allocation decision, but almost always, we have the data of the entire asset\u2019s story of the business, and we can\u2019t assess the Return of Capital for every single project.

If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell.

Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long",

It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS.

From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors.

Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock.

The most recent and known bubble was the dotcom bubble. At the end of the 90s it became evident that informatic technology was going to be a game changer. People start to lose their mind about every company that rhymes with .com or dot or @ or every other synonymous of computer science.

How to avoid being caught in a bubble? Stick with fundamentals and your circle of competence (10. Circle of competence). Invest in a company that you know and that generates cash now.

Eventually the moat reassures us, if business has an advantage over the competitors, this advantage increases the reliability of our forecast about future cash generated by our company. Over the long run many competitors are going to try to take a piece of the pie (i.e., users, customers, revenue, cash flow). We need to defend our wealth.In the future we are going to talk also about, like a king, how much lands you need in order to increase your wealth (portfolio). \u201cEquity is the new land.

Well, what happened in the last quarter? Berkshire decided to repurchase its own shares for an amount of 9 Billion dollars, already in the previous quarter, Buffett repurchased 5.1 Billion. Since the start of the Covid-19 crisis that crashed the market, Buffett gave to $BRK shareholders a total of 14.1 Billion. I have to say that I\u2019m a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and this decision make me happy for two reasons: 1) Buffett felt that BRK was undervalued, this means that I bought BRK at a fair price. Basically, my evaluation was right from Buffett\u2019s perspective. 2) The price of BRK rises propelled by share repurchase, therefore my wealth grows. Fig",

An important lesson we can extrapolate from this event: A good company uses his money to invest in his own business when Mr Market (8. Mr Market) throws good prices. But the most important point is the balance sheet of the company. In other words a lot of cash and low debt, in this way, when the crisis comes, management can take the opportunities that arise from. \u201cIn the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity\u201d Sun Tzu Not every management repurchases shares in the best moment, often managers repurchase shares when the price is very high. In periods of widespread optimism, many managers in order to please shareholders and to exercise their options (Management stock options: we will return on this point, ELI5: benefits to management if stocks reach a certain price) they do buybacks in the worst period, when the stock price is overvalued. Fig.3 Boeing ($BA) shares rep and debt pile Fig.4 Boeing ($BA) stock price Those two images are enough to explain what goes wrong with Boeing. Managers repurchase shares when the price was high, moreover, they do buybacks while piling a lot of debt, instead of doing that with cash produced by the business itself (Free cash flow). I\u2019ll remind a notion that I have already explained in a previous article: if managers repurchases shares when the price is high, they reduce the total ownership less than if they do buybacks when the price is low.

Speculators buy stocks waiting for another buyer who pays more and they gain thanks to the difference, an investor instead buys a business and his gain depends on the quality of the management and the cash generated by the business itself. The former hopes to find a buyer, sometimes only more fools than him. The latter invests in the business for the long run and gains because of the business itself not for the willingness of other speculators to pay more for the same piece of paper.

The main goal of qualitative analysis (stories) is to understand the business\u2019s side that it can\u2019t be quantified in numbers terms. For example, understand how the persons behind the decision are, make an inquiry about the CEO. Who is? From where s/he came from? What did s/he do in the past? Did s/he grow in the firm culture or s/he is external to the company? Moreover, we want to know the goal of the firms and the culture inside the firms. Culture defines the value within the company.

This part will be subject to future articles, because the competitive advantage is a crucial point, and it lies in the most part in the narrative side of the analysis. A competitive advantage allows the firm to survive and become stronger over time. Warren Buffett defined the competitive advantage of a company as the moat of a castle, a series of intrinsic attributes of a business that defend it by the outside attacks from other businesses that want to gain our customers and our market share, for example, Pepsi Vs.

Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, owes some of his fortunes to Coke (KO). He invests a lot of money in it, and he becomes rich even thanks to this soft drink brand. The interesting side of this story is that he started his love story with the brand when he was young. When he was a child he collected a refund from recycled Coke bottles. Over time he never lost his passion about the brand. He bought his first share in 1988. Then he never sold, instead he bought more over time, when Mr. Market (article 8. Mr. Market) gives him opportunities to buy at a low price. \u201cOf a certainty, it was in 1936 that I started buying Cokes at the rate of six for 25 cents from Buffett & Son, the family grocery store, to sell around the neighborhood for 5 cents each. In this excursion into high-margin retailing, I duly observed the extraordinary consumer attractiveness and commercial possibilities of the product. I continued to note these qualities for the next 52 years as Coke blanketed the world.

Life, economy, business. The economy follows a cyclical pattern, the same is true for human life and business life but we will dig deeper into business life when we will talk about valuation. Economic cycles are mainly defined by the relation between credits and debts. The best explanation on this matter was published by Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Hedge Fund.If you want a more comprehensive description I invite you to watch his video lesson on youtube How the economic machine works.I think is important to understand the basics of how the economic machine works in order to be a good investor. Time Value. Basically a debt is an agreement between two parts that money given today (principal) will be repaid in the future with a premium (interest). It\u2019s obvious that if I give you a sum of money I expect to be paid for the time that my money is in your hand.In other words, with this money I can do various things that give me a return, then if I decide to give you this money, I lose the opportunity to invest in other things that could have a return. This is called the time value of money and it is one of the most fundamental notions in finance. The power of debt. Meanwhile, you have my money, you can use this money to generate a profit greater than the interests you will pay to me. Typically",

They can lend money to other individuals (households debt) or corporations (corporate bonds). Government and state also are in debt. The principle doesn\u2019t change.All those entities ideally borrow money with the goal to create more wealth in the future in order to repay the principal plus interest and make the gain. The best example to describe those dynamics is a simple business like a farm. Imagine that a farmer has already a land, paid with his own money. Now he wants to sow wheat but he doesn\u2019t have a tractor, the farmer has 2 choices: saving for months until he can buy the tractor or take a loan and buying the tractor now, this means earn already now. An obvious part of future gains will be utilized to repay the principal and to pay interest, but if he does the math he can earn more and he will develop his business.I have deliberately left out debts related to private consumption like a new TV, new car, new tablet because is not a matter of this blog and I think is a stupid use of this instrument.Instead of getting into debt to buy useless stuff, learn the art of saving. \u201cDo not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving.\u201d Warren Buffett This mechanism creates the economic cycle, the time where we get into debts and we grow and time where we have to pay back this debt then our spending capacity",

Do you remember? In the last article (8. Mr. Market) I spoke about the contrarian attitude of a good investor.It\u2019s very hard to be a contrarian because humans like animals are subjected to herd bias. Why is it so hard to be a contrarian? Because animals in the middle of the herd tend to behave like the other members of the herd, mostly when there is an upcoming threat and little time to think what to do.Under pressure and in the middle of uncertainty we will follow the herd because we believe it\u2019s safer to stay with the crowd. I would say that most of the time this is true, but sometimes the herd reacts in an emotional way through a self-reinforced pattern, because every member follows the next fellow and that generates a chain reaction (bubble, in the case of the stock market. Remember GoPro chart?)Today is a hard time for value investors. With a lot of money flooded in the system, whenever you put your money you will see your capital gain, but untilwhen?

Some days he gets very enthused, some days he gets very depressed. And when he gets really enthused you sell to him, and if he gets depressed, you buy from him.

Your wealth will generate over the long term.What causes that short term fluctuations? As I said early, the stock market has an emotional reaction to any short term news that click bait media throws us.The modern world is full of news, data and information, this because there is always someone making a living thanks to your click on the last news s/he writes.The secret is to concentrate on fundamentals data and not on the latest news on CNBC network, and that\u2019s the goal of my blog.But if you are enthused about Tesla\u2019s chart, I will show another chart that shows you what happens when emotion takes place of rationality.

        "text": "in touch with us? As I explained in the preceding chapters, businesses use the stock market to finance their activities.Basically there are two ways that companies use for financing themselves: debt and equity.My blog focuses on equity holders or also called shareholders.As shareholders we own a piece of business, while debt holders (bondholders) finance the companies through credits.Usually bondholders, because they are not owners, they are the first allowed to claim their money if the company goes bankrupt. There is a sort of hierarchy of claim where the shareholders are the last allowed to claim their part of the company\u2019s wealth after default.This mechanic put the shareholders in a risky position but even gives us the probability of a better gain.Bondholder return is given and limited while return for shareholders is potentially unlimited.But don\u2019t worry, that risk can be managed and I will explain to you how to do it in future articles.Our objective is to find good companies that pay us back as much as possible.This idea is called \u201cCapital allocation\u201d. Namely find where to put money in order to obtain the maximum return on capital. Returns are essentially divided in 3 main ways: Dividends Buybacks Retained earnings Dividends The most simple and direct method that companies use to share their profits with investors. Dividends are a percentage of the total amount of the capital invested that is pay back monthly or yearly.For example Coke Company pays a dividend of 1.64 USD for every share that in this moment worth approximately 46 USD per share (08 august",

Usually this dividend is destined to grow over time. Fig 2. Coke dividend growth Buybacks Another option to share profit is through stocks buybacks.Company buys its own shares in order to reduce the number of circulating shares, doing so investors gain thanks to the rise in percentage owned by the company.For example: if I had a company that was worth 100b and I divided this company into 100 pieces (stocks), every investor owns 1/100 of the company and therefore 1/100 of the profit. But what happens if I remove 10 pieces of this company shares? Now the remaining investors own 1/90 of the company or in other words a bigger piece of the pie.A good management buys back stocks when the market price is below the intrinsic value. What is intrinsic value? I will explain in future articles. Summing up, intrinsic value or fair value, it is the value of the firm based on its intrinsic characteristics. Like the value of a car is based on the horsepower or on the brand\u2019s value.Remember: the value of a company IS NOT the market price.The price is only what the other investors are willing to pay for receiving the ownership of the business.

        "text": "Attributed to Albert Einstein The concept behind the compound interest is very simple.Imagine you have a bank account that earn you an annual interest of 4% (it is an utopias today), if you put 1000USD in your bank account the 1 january of the year, at the end of the year your account gain is 40USD (1000*0.04), hence you will start the new year with 1040USD on your account. If the next year the bank will give you another 4% interest rate and you don\u2019t withdraw money at the end of the year, you will end with the initial amount of 1040USD plus interest, but this time the interest would be 4% of 1040USD that will be 41.6USD for a total of 1081.6 in year two.This pattern will be followed for the following years and it will become exponential. Below you can see the result after 30 years of compounding for only 1000USD at 4% yearly without further deposits. Fig 1. Compound interest 1000usd 30 years later at 4% You can test the potential of this concept through the link below: Compound interest calculator US gov As investors this becomes relevant, because our goal is to find businesses that compound their capital, consequently our wealth far above 4%.Personally I look for companies that compound 15%+.

If there is a lot more money, this money loses value. Fig 1. US Dollars debasement What does it mean for those who don\u2019t invest? It means that the value of their bank account decreases over time.Today interests on bank accounts are very low, much less than the inflation that affects your currency.Another reason to invest even just in an Index fund, like I spoke in the last article.

What is the difference? Stock market is composed by many companies that produce a broad range of products and services. These companies together make the basement of the country productivity.Because the world follows a growing path in terms of circulating money, number of citizens and consequently numbers of products and services, if we add up the value of all the national company or from a specific sector, and we buy a piece of that collection, over time we will gain thanks to the growth of the worldwide Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Fig. 1 source Federal Reserve As you can see in the US the circulating money is growing and that money goes into the pockets of those who invest. For example, I often heard people complaining about riches. The difference between poor and rich is that the riches take assets through the investing practice, while poors take liabilities because they spend all their income for short-term futile purpose.

A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing",

If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales.

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years.

Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested.

Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner.

Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield.

Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value.

What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side.

The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales.

Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years.

The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure",

Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)).

        "text": "Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors.

Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium",

The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell.

What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products.

A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets.

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war).

Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers.

Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs.

If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond.

What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run).

How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS.

Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield.

Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock.

Noah\u2019s ark In the first part of our overview, we analyzed the income statement, now we are going to look at the capital structure of our business, namely: the balance sheet. If earnings are our engine, the balance sheet is the frame of our machine. I like using allegory to make the point, in this case a good one could be the hull of a boat. In the holy bible Noah was a God\u2019s prophet, in his days the God warned Noah about the advent of a catastrophic flooding, and he ordered him to build a boat in order to survive. God gives to Noah the technical specificity of the ark. Time passes but there is always an upcoming apocalypse to worry about, it is the cyclical nature of our universe. If we invest for the long run, our boat has to survive financial floods and storms, in other words: bubbles and bust (Article Stock Market Crash). There are some characteristics that make our boat apocalypse-proof. We always hear about financial crises, our duty is not to anticipate these events (it is quite",

Mr Market) Equity Simply put, this is your piece of the cake. What amount of money, hypothetically, would be returned to you as an owner if the company would be liquidated. Equity can also be called book value. For some sectors or businesses, book value per share can be a useful metric (notoriously in the past Warren Buffett buybacks $BRK stock under 1.2 times book value, as a sort of proxy to define the intrinsic value, indeed a smooth growth in equity could be a good sign). Example: individual = Equity is what belongs to you after you deduct the mortgage of your house from the total value, that\u2019s the Equity of your home. It is composed by two essential parts: Original investment and later investment Retaining earnings: is the percentage of profit that was not paid as dividend/buybacks, accumulated overtime and can be reinvested for new projects and acquisition or used to pay off debt.

Another reason worth noting is that some companies are international, then they have assets in foreign currency exposed to local devaluation risks to compensate for this devaluation the company takes a debt in the same currency, in order to take advantage of local currency devaluation without trapping money in countries with weak currency. Leases Lease is a contract between two parties, where the lessee pays the lessors for an asset use. Be careful, capital leases are counted as liabilities. A new FASB rule, effective Dec. 15, 2018, requires that all leases unless they are shorter than 12 months must be recognized on the balance sheet. Number of common stock We have already discussed the notion of share repurchases (how companies reward us). I want to highlight an aspect, companies not only repurchase shares, but sometimes they issue new fresh stocks, having the opposite effect: namely diluting the stocks count thus devaluing the value of a single stock.

Companies can pay investors, employees or even what they need with stocks. We, as investors gain, when there are fewer stocks, because in this manner we own a big piece of the cake. On the other hand the management could pay itself and the employer with stocks (Stock Based Compensation). Nothing wrong about it, if employees and management are themselves owners could mean that they act like owners in the interest of us, as investors. This is a complex argument that needs a separate article, but it is worth remembering for the next article where we are going to analyze the cash flow. Other than that it is good to look at the number of share counts over time in order to understand if the company is diluting our earning participation. The management must treat shares as if they are gold bullions, nothing wrong using stock as a currency, but only if the exchange is worth our gold bullions.

Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years.

If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond.

What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future.

Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)).

From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator.

Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock.

Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple.

To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets.

R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war).

As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers.

Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture.

What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece",

The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS.

The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.).

Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses.

The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business.

Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded.

Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing.

To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?).

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders.

Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs.

If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond.

The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins.

Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and",

The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is",

If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill.

Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition.

You must value the business in order to value the stock.\u201d Charlie Munger Over time what counts about a business isn\u2019t the emotional attitude of Mr. Market or the economic cycle. What really matters is how much money the business makes in order to grow, repurchase its own stocks or pay a dividend, the price follows the right path in the long haul. Fig 3. Red line \u2013 stable fundamental growth vs black line \u2013 Mr. Market irrational quotations. I want to highlight two aspects of the value investor attitude: Contarian attitude Patience It requires patience because it can takes time for the market to recognize the value of a company conversely it can takes times for Mr Market to offers you a good business at an interesting price. The father of Value Investing once said: \u201cThe stock investor is neither right or wrong because others agreed or disagreed with him; he is right because his facts and analysis are right.\u201d Benjamin Graham While is the best student added: \u201cThe stock market is a device for transferring",

He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn\u2019t, pays it.\u201d Attributed to Albert Einstein The concept behind the compound interest is very simple.Imagine you have a bank account that earn you an annual interest of 4% (it is an utopias today), if you put 1000USD in your bank account the 1 january of the year, at the end of the year your account gain is 40USD (1000*0.04), hence you will start the new year with 1040USD on your account.

He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn\u2019t, pays it.\u201d Attributed to Albert Einstein The concept behind the compound interest is very simple.Imagine you have a bank account that earn you an annual interest of 4% (it is an utopias today), if you put 1000USD in your bank account the 1 january of the year, at the end of the year your account gain is 40USD (1000*0.04), hence you will start the new year with 1040USD on your account. If the next year the bank will give you another 4% interest rate and you don\u2019t withdraw money at the end of the year, you will end with the initial amount of 1040USD plus interest, but this time the interest would be 4% of 1040USD that will be 41.6USD for a total of 1081.6 in year two.This pattern will be followed for the following years and it will become exponential. Below you can see the result after 30 years of compounding for only 1000USD at 4% yearly without further deposits. Fig 1. Compound interest 1000usd 30 years later at 4% You can test the potential of this concept through the link below: Compound interest calculator US gov As investors this becomes relevant, because our goal is to find businesses that compound their capital, consequently our wealth far above 4%.Personally I look for companies that",

They believe that the key to success is to work hard to offer customers low margins, eliminate defects, and be efficient. They also believe that companies should reward customers disproportionately early in their development, and that decisions should be based on math rather than judgment. Jeff Bezos of Amazon is an example of a founder who is willing to be misunderstood and do what is right for the customer in the long-term. He believes that by consistently lowering prices, Amazon will create a virtuous cycle that will lead to more free cash flow and a more valuable company. He also believes that advertising is the price you pay for having an unremarkable product or service.

Debt is useful and its scope is to generate wealth in our society, but it can become a problem if an individual, a business or a society brings more debt than is productive output. Companies may have cash and debt for various reasons, such as tax advantages or foreign currency devaluation. Leases are contracts between two parties, where the lessee pays the lessor for an asset use, and must be recognized on the balance sheet. Companies may issue new stocks, which can dilute the value of a single stock.

It provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. The top line of the income statement is the revenue, which is the raw fuel of the company. The profitability of the company is determined by the quality of the revenue, which is determined by the efficiency of the company and the pricing power it has. Pricing power is developed through marketing and can protect owners' wealth from inflation.",

Dividends are a percentage of the total capital invested that is paid back monthly or yearly. Buybacks reduce the number of circulating shares, allowing investors to gain a bigger piece of the pie. Retained earnings are kept by the company for various tasks, and if the management is competent, investors can gain from organic growth or smart acquisitions.

You have growth, thus deflationary forces (which compensate for the abundant liquidity), only if you have liquidity but knowledge as well. If you just inject liquidity, but the system don\u2019t have any new idea to optimize itself because too lazy, it\u2019s like try to reanimate a 100 yo man injecting liters of adrenaline in his veins, it didn\u2019t find its way because the patient is dead. The more liquidity they put in the system the more this liquidity find its way in bitcoin as a buffer, which, unlike gold (which is a dead asset), it\u2019s a tech tool that improves and finds new way to express himself (for instance it give resources to unbanked populations, which give them the opportunity to finance the knowledge they have, but because of a lack of capital, they can\u2019t express. Gives also them the opportunity to exploit renewable resources to be part of the system as a miners, which brings them more resources to develop themselves.). Every time the CBs inject money in the system, they are financing their substitute, like a spillover effect.Now, interest rate increasing it\u2019s like cutting the supplying during a war, if Bitcoin can resist better than the society itself, it will thrive but a period of volatility is the fragility shock an anti fragile system has to weather.The big problem is define the value bitcoin, it\u2019s quite simple to do it for an earning asset but almost impossible for bitcoin.

Transhumanism, you might say it\u2019s just a change, whether that change is positive or negative is unstated. But optimalism is, in a sense, you\u2019re improving. You\u2019re getting better.

My journey. When I was young I went through a stressful period in my life. In order to survive I looked at myself in the mirror and I thought \u201cI\u2019ve to become a superhero, stronger, faster, smarter and resilient. How can I obtain those superpowers?\u201d To be honest what counted for me at the time was my physical appearance and the psychological illusion to become invincible through muscle mass and some knowledge of martial arts. In reality what I discovered through a journey that took years, is that the most important weapon is our mind; the body is only a side effect which tells us if we are following the correct path. Fig. 2 Clue: The blue pill is full of sugars Warning: My opinion is that in order to maintain focus and discipline in life, it\u2019s important to deeply understand the reasons behind a goal. In fact this essay will be a deep journey through evolution, darwinism, psychology, society, biology, micro and macro economy. Every important aspect of our life is part of the whole, a holistic approach and multidisciplinary models are needed. If you find it boring, no problem, clearly freedom isn\u2019t your priority. Surely our society gives you some pointless alternatives where you can waste your time. For the few free men and women who decide to take the red pills,I will show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.This article was meant to be an informative and motivational piece. I hope to instill and to fuel the motivation to improve our community to become stronger than entropy. In order to become self-sovereign we need to become self responsable of our knowledge, health and wealth, seeking for the truth and defending it against their enemies. What are we going to learn? Why nutrition has always been fundamental Sugars, proteins, hormones and autophagy Who defines social standards? Who profits? Eat less, eat qualitative Email Address But let\u2019s start with the basics Fig. 3 Charles Darwin When I think about humans my memory recalls some stuff about the evolution of our species. Yes, we are what we are today because of a series of improvements obtained thanks to some biological adaptations, mainly caused by genes but not only. It seems indeed that the best tool we have gained through evolutionary processes is mainly the consequence of our ability to handle food, our cerebral cortex growth was exponential when we discovered how to cook and conserve food, this gives us regularity in our meals and the ability to feed ourselves in tranches of more digestible food instead of having irregular big meals of raw food. Fire gives us the opportunity to delegate part of the digestive process to the fire\u2019s energy; indeed fire makes the digestive process less energy demanding, increasing the absorption of nutrients, unlocking these excess energy to cognitive processes. \u201cMechanisms contributing to energy being gained from cooking include increased digestibility of starch and protein, reduced costs of digestion for cooked versus raw meat, and reduced energetic costs of detoxification and defence against pathogens.\u201d pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Fig 3. Humans evolution trajectory (not necessarily suggesting causation but undoubtedly, something happens or probably a series of events.) That\u2019s partially thanks to the discovery of a phenomenal technology, namely Fire (Fire discovery: 1.7 years ago). Greeks thought that fire was the gift of Prometheus, the titan who stole this technology from the gods to bring it to humans. Source: faculty.ksu.edu.sa If fire were the technology which brought us to the sapiens level, probably something tied to the manipulation of nutrients will bring us to the next level of our species. I\u2019m not a doctor but I think I have sufficient brain power (and surely the same holds true for my followers) to improve my diet by myself using the research that I can find from respectable resources around the web and experiment this new discovery on myself, feel my body and understand what makes me healthier and what prejudices my wellbeing. I quickly discovered that neither my doctors nor my nutritionist is willing to read tons of research in order to improve my health, so I decided to take responsibility for my health and do my homeworks, the same I did for my wealth studying e sharing material on this topic. My journey started 20 years ago and overtime my diet drastically changed. I will analyze with you the basic pillars which define the last version of my nutritional approach.Every point of my essay will be followed by a reference to the source, usually a research paper. \u201cNLM is the world\u2019s #BiomedicalResearch engine, providing scientists with the tools, methods, & databanks necessary to better understand & improve health. Learn more about NLM\u2019s role in this video narrated by @NLMdirector\u201d nlm.nih.gov How did we decide, as a species, to slow down our evolution? In other words, we are slaves for the incentives of who? If cooking and eating is that important, why are we starting to eat junk food? It is simple; years of well funded advertising campaigns have manipulated our mind at the advantage of some shareholders which make profits thanks to a high gross margin in relation to what we eat in their \u201crestaurants\u201d. In other words we buy low quality food and in the meantime we finance better advertising which consequently develops new illusions to convince us to eat shit (more sugars, less fiber, less high quality proteins, \u2026) all this to improve the bottom line of junk food dealers\u2019 financial statements. Fig 4. This curve is proportional to our insanity as a species and represents the margins of gain of a notorious fast food chain, inversely proportional to the quality of macro/micro nutrients intake. Note: There are other financial dynamics involved but it is worth noting that even if currency tends to devalue junk food dealers are gaining bargaining power with suppliers and customers over time. Fig. 5 How the errors starts from infancy Interesting because society teaches young people what tastes good therefore young people teach their parents where and what to eat. Who is the educator here? Ok Dave but this shit is tasty! Our perception of good or bad, beauty or ugliness, good taste or bad taste is highly dependent on our culture. If you grow up in an environment where sauces, sugars drinks, and low quality beef between two pieces of low quality bread are highly advertised, all your friends eat Mcdonalds too, and therefore most of your childhood memories are tied to a Fast Food, you will probably associate fast food as one your best experiences. Having a healthy lifestyle requires effort and the willingness to recalibrate our taste buds, in other words align our concept of tasty with the brick of a healthy diet. Most of us are addicted to sensory perceptions, like for example the sweet taste which does not exist in a natural environment but the industry energizing in order to enslave us to inexistent taste, investing the money distorting our short term brain sensations at the expense of the nutritional contents for long term health consequences. This quote by David Deutsch in my opinion is perfectly applicable also to taste, because taste is a form of beauty, a sensorial feeling of something good. \u201cCould it be purely cultural? We pursue beauty as well as truth, and in both cases we can be fooled. Perhaps we see a face as beautiful because it really is, or perhaps it is only because of a combination of our genes and our culture. A beetle is attracted to another beetle that you and I may see as hideous. But not if you are an entomologist. People can learn to see many things as beautiful or ugly.\u201d David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity The same in my opinion is applicable to good or bad taste. \u201cThe attribute we call beauty is of two kinds. One is a parochial kind of attractiveness, local to a species, to a culture or to an individual. The other is unrelated to any of those: it is universal, and as objective as the laws of physics.\u201d David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity Food is attractive because of a good marketing companion and ingrained cultural roots and there is objective good food, a meal with genuine products which not only satisfies our taste but is also engineered to improve the performance of our chemical factory, named body, some examples at the end of the article. I would suggest you read my article on an apparently unrelated topic, where I speak about mindshare Coke and Santa Klaus (15. Income Statement \u2013 Mindshare) in order to understand the level of manipulation we are subjected to and the deep impact of advertising on our mind since we are children. An example of how much broad the concept of good or beauty can be broad: H\u00e1karl (an abbreviation of k\u00e6stur h\u00e1karl Icelandic pronunciation: \u200b[\u02c8c\u02b0aist\u028fr \u02c8hau\u02d0\u02cck\u02b0a(r)tl\u0325], referred to as fermented shark in English) is a national dish of Iceland consisting of a Greenland shark or other sleeper shark that has been cured with a particular fermentation process and hung to dry for four to five months.[1] It has a strong ammonia-rich smell and fishy taste, making h\u00e1karl an acquired taste.[2]\u2026Chef Anthony Bourdain described fermented shark as \u201cthe single worst, most disgusting and terrible tasting thing\u201d he had ever eaten.\u2026Archaeologist Neil Oliver tasted h\u00e1karl in the BBC documentary Vikings as part of his examination of the Viking diet. He described it as reminiscent of \u201cblue cheese but a hundred times stronger.\u201d Source: WIkipedia The notion of a good taste could be very broad, then it\u2019s possible to recalibrate our taste to appreciate healthy foods, the concept of good taste paired by the notion of healthy. Mental performance and emotional stability. Even if I started primarily focusing on physical performance, I reach the conclusion that the main goal of a diet is mental performance. Qualitative food, exercises and fasting are part of a progress through the enhancement of our ability to absorb more information, connect more dots and become more creative. Our brain is an organic CPU and through a multidisciplinary approach we can learn how to gain some horsepower and reduce the noise. The body itself is the litmus paper of our progress and not a final goal, It shows us if we are going in the right direction. If we are doing the right thing our body becomes aesthetically more pleasing, but don\u2019t confuse the aspect with the meaning, the risk is to end up using shortcuts such as for example roids. \u201cYour duty is to stand straight, not held straight\u201d Marcus Aurelius Over time I abandoned the idea of practicing competitive sport, since I noticed that competitiveness tends to bring people to sacrifice their health for their performance. My current approach is to improve my health and my performance based on myself and my physical and mental limits. Limits exist to be overcome, but everyone has their own timing, there is no rush, you have decades of time to mentally improve yourself, train yourself hard but not too hard to ruin yourself. \u201cThe best armor of old age is a well-spent life preceding it.\u201d Charlie Munger But, does this have to do with our emotions? Sugar acts on the dopaminergic system rewarding our brain without merits. In other words, we are addicted in a similar way to a cocaine junkie. Why does sugar reward us? Because in nature finding a high energetical source of food is a business which requires determination and tenacity, there is an equilibrium between energy delivered and conquered energy. An incorrectly calibrated reward system can bring us into depression and anxiety, evolution sets us to be rewarded when we accomplish something great for our tribe, not because we pay to feel rewarded, that creates tons of trouble along the way. Then when you will reduce your sugar intake brace yourself for the classical withdrawal symptoms, or maybe you will go in denial mode and you will deny your addiction. \u201cIf a dietary approach to treating psychotic symptoms was suggested, what might this regime look like? Glycemic index (GI) describes the rate of absorption of glucose from carbohydrate. High GI carbohydrate foods, such as white bread, sugar and refined cereals, cause a \u2018spike\u2019 in insulin and blood glucose (followed by a dip). Low GI carbohydrate foods, such as wholegrain bread and most vegetables (or foods containing little carbohydrate at all, such as nuts, seeds and meat), produce a slower insulin response and thus a more steady supply of glucose to the blood. Low GI diets induce weight loss and improve blood glucose control in people with diabetes. A recent meta-analysis showed that people following a low GI diet had more weight loss than other diets [48]. \u201c\u2026\u201cStudies of the effects of low glycaemic index diets on dopamine release are yet to be carried out, however anecdotal reports suggest an initial discomfort and craving after starting this regime, which suggests a component of withdrawal.\u201d\u2026\u201cThe common link drawn between eating, psychosis and mid-brain dopaminergic reward, logically, suggests that psychosis may be improved, by modifying carbohydrate consumption. \u201c ncbi.nlm.nih.gov That said I want to reiterate and highlight my goal: Enhance my cognitive performance, enhance my physical performance, live longer in a healthy mind and body, prolong my ability to compound my knowledge thanks to a clear mind and healthy body. And above all, not be a slave. I can define 3 main topics helpful to reach our goals Nutrition Body Mind In my opinion nutrition is the first and foremost pillar to reinforce, hence I will divide my write up starting from here. Body will be the second article, that\u2019s because in my view and because of my experience, through the body I understood the importance of mind. Mind which will be the last article of this series. Mind, the last, will be brief, because if you understand and put in practice the first two chapters, mental health will be a natural consequence, thus understanding the importance of physical food, teaching the importance of mental food and understanding the importance of body exercises to teach the importance of mind exercises. I hope to give some tools to the network state citizens to become the citizens of a renewed enlightened Athene and not part of a declining Rome. Nutrition Our body is like a machine, therefore just like every machine, it needs a correct mixture of molecules and compounds to work efficiently. I always find it mind-blowing that most people don\u2019t think about their nutrition in these terms, moreover our body is composed of organic tissues that in order to give us its\u2019 best and become stronger it needs the bricks necessary to produce muscle, skeletal solidity and mental clarity. Training hard without strong tissue fed with good nutrients will quickly bring you to some injury. Fig 5. A healthy body is an engineering work We have two enemies to fight when it come to diet: The first is yourself. The second is society. At the end of the day society shapes everybody by empowering their will through social proof, it takes a strong character to fight against this mechanism. \u201cthe principle of social proof. It states that one means we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct.\u201d Prof Robert B. Cialdini Here we have a great example, an analysis by Charlie Munger who invested heavily in Coke (water+sugar) through his holding, Berkshire. Fig 6. Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack Note: Sugar has another effect on our body. The excess of sugar floating in your bloodstream causes water to balance out. This causes fluid retention and thirst sensations, where you will end up consuming more of this product (for the pure joy of the producer). Advertisers and food industry corporations exploit our instincts in order to enslave us to their products. Sugars are the best example, in nature we have access to few sources of energy and these few sources are reachable only after a proportional physical effort, then we are prone to tirelessly search for high energy foods like fruits. Fig. 7 Hostile environment The reward role of sugar in a hostile ecosystem, characterised by seasons, scarcity and enemies, makes it the erotic dream of every animal, and the animal inside of us is our worst enemy. Exploited by the food industry, tobacco industry, social media, streaming platforms, retailers.. I want to highlight a point here: Sugar is an enemy in our current ecosystem, because its abundance coupled with a sedentary lifestyle, isn\u2019t necessarily bad if correctly handled. Personally I appreciate a slice of watermelon during the hot summer days, maybe after a run, a great supplement rich in sugars, electrolytes and water. Discipline. This instinct was weaponized by the food industry, then as usual, we have to make counter intuitive choices, or counter instinctive if you will, in order to improve our status. The environment around you will result in our change and it will try to discourage us. Insulin slavery You have to change your habits and commit to resetting your taste buds. If you use artificial sweetener you will only change your master. \u201cGroup A patients who consumed artificial sweetening agents had higher insulin resistance as compared to group B patients who had no artificial sweeteners based on HOMA-IR\u201d ncbi.nlm.nih.gov This means that your body is unable to stabilize your glucose in an efficient way and we have already spoken about the effect of the glucose in our blood, Artificial sweeteners are only the umptheent illusion of the food industry. \u201cYou can avoid reality, but you cannot avoid the consequences of avoiding reality. Ayn Rand Fig 8. As usual but not necessary, we see a correlation with artificial sweeteners, but surely something to think about Fasting has the exact opposite effect, it improves insulin sensitivity, which means that your body is able to make the best use of the sugars your intake, reducing the need of more sugar and stabilizing your insulin which in turn reduces the feeling of hunger which causes irritability even if your body is sufficiently fed. \u201cThe results of the present study also demonstrate that intermittent fasting during Ramadan may lead to concomitant beneficial effects by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing insulin resistance. \u201c ncbi.nlm.nih.gov We are unfortunately coded to lose this battle, without self discipline our mind goes on autopilot and becomes the puppet of our instincts. The number 1 enemy is sugar. The first thing I learned years ago were the harmful effects of sugar. We often talk about that but in my opinion, in order to take a stronger position in our life against this addiction we have to deeply understand how it works. Even if we reduce the intake as much as we can, we will always absorb too much of it in this society, so don\u2019t worry. Cancer cells metabolism and chemical energy Cancer cells seem less able to metabolize oxygen, and subsequently become hungry of glucose. \u201cCancer cells rewire their metabolism to promote growth, survival, proliferation, and long-term maintenance. The common feature of this altered metabolism is increased glucose uptake and fermentation of glucose to lactate.\u201d ncbi.nlm.nih.gov On this topic other studies are often incomplete and discordant. I\u2019m not suggesting that a low carb diet or less sugar helps to fight cancers, but surely there is something to think about mainly in the context of a preventive approach. As society we have also decided to throw away fibers, which are indispensable to regulate our glucose blood level. Lack of fiber causes sugar spikes in our blood that when passed make you more hungry and feel energy depleted. Thus you will eat more and someone will gain more money at the expense of your wellbeing. \u201cOur studies confirm the observation 14 that fiber added to meals reduces the rise in glucose concentration in normal subjects and non-insulin dependent diabetic individuals, and further tends to confirm the observation 2.5 that fiber improves glucose tolerance.\u201d \u201cNonetheless, the finding in this study of unaltered insulin levels but marked reduction in glucose levels with the addition of small amounts of fiber suggests that fiber might exert its effect on glucose levels by a mechanism other than an altered insulin response.\u201d diabetesjournals.org Fiber and one of the leading cause of cancer-related deaths correlation \u201cIn conclusion, the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis present strong and consistent evidence that dietary fiber is associated with reduced risks of both proximal colon and distal colon cancers, and that the association between dietary fiber intake and risk of colon cancer does not differ by cancer subsite.\u201d ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Hormones. Hormones are the best tool our body gives us. We can leverage this tool using diet and training in order to improve their production and put our body in the condition to optimize its ability to metabolize these tools at best. Yes, there are people who ask help from their pharmacists to obtain some drugs, but my opinion is that our body is the best pharmacists, a healthy body understands in real time our needs and fills up our tissues with the correct mixture if we give it the opportunity to work well, the problem arise if some components of the mixture are absent because of our fault, Spoiler: eat a hamburger for 2 dollars at the nearest fast food isn\u2019t the best mixture. What I immediately understand is the importance of testosterone and growth hormone e their response to various type of food: Testosterone This hormone is incredibly important for the body composition but not only, it is also for our mind giving you more energy and more focus, it seems also that it positively affects memory. Optimizing its productions seems like a good idea. It seems again that the foods we introduce in our body mainly affects our cognitive skills. A part of our testosterone is converted into estradiol (an estrogen steroid hormone, the major female sex hormone) by a process called aromatase. Body fat levels increase the amount of testosterone converted, and therefore if our goal is to optimize the production of these hormones, then a low level of body fat is required. On the other hand though, as our body uses fat to metabolize testosterone, then it is important to have a balanced amount of fat in our diet, removing fats from our diets is a common mistake in this sense. Growth Hormone There is a connection between growth hormones and sugar, it seems indeed that in a hypoglycemic state our body produces an exponential quantity of HGH, the role of HGH is to maintain a healthy body composition and preserve muscle mass. \u201cthe mean GH response was significantly diminished when the men received glucose (8.12 \u00b1 1.12 ng/ml) compared to that when they received only water (23.70 \u00b1 8.46 ng/ml; P < 0.01). Thus, hyperglycemia may exert an inhibitory effect on the plasma hGHRH-44.\u201d academic.oup.com Why are we dependent? Fig 9. source: https://www.ultrahuman.com/ provided by ojas.\u221e(1729 member, twitter handle linked), thank you! I had a briefly conversation with ojas.\u221e about his experience with the tracker He used it for 6 weeks in order to check his Bloody Sugar Level (BSL). I was curious about the 9 Jun spike and I ask to him some informations, our brief chat on this topic: Dave Soma: And Im curious on have some insights about your diet during the data gathering. In mean I saw an interesting spike in glucose at some point, have you any opinions on that or on the food you ingested. ojas.\u221e: In terms of times/days when my BSL spikes, it is because I have had (potentially) high carb & less protein diet and (probably) didn\u2019t follow-up w/ a walk. also if i went to bed past midnight & woke up early the following day \u2014 i.e. not enough rest/sleep, the following day my body is slower in metabolising glucose (i think ) My opinion is that we are dependent on everything working in spikes. What do I mean? Some time ago I read a research paper that analyzed the reason why we are so addicted to social media, taking cigarettes as a parallelism of this phenomenon, put in simple words every news or image we scroll, as every puff of cigarette, creates a dopamine spike which makes these habits addictive. The stock market also works in the same way, as it presents to you the value of a company as a real time graph of price action, which has literally no sense from a financial standpoint (8.Mr. Market article). But it doesnt end here, even sex creates the same problem, another study on mice demostrated that the dopaminic leves in a mouse coupled with the same partner tends to decrease and stabilize overtime, in the mean time a mouse costantly exposed to new sexual partners tends to feel a costant series of dopaminic spikes. Sugar tends to produce a huge insulinic and dopamine spike, this gives us sensations of pleasure and an energetic push but in the meantime creates a huge problem to our body, as every vicious addiction. In other words we are wired to seek a spike in our feelings instead of a stable flux, my intuition is that this is tied to our tendency, as humans, to be short term oriented. \u201cSo, many things improve if you can take a long term. By the way, it\u2019s not natural for humans. It\u2019s a discipline that you have to build.\u201d Jeff Bezos In a natural context we need to complete our mission as animals in the shortest possible time because our life is constantly threatened, our body rewards us for short time accomplishment in a hostile environment. This changed with the development of technology which unlocked the chance to live one hundred years and more and maybe, over time, become an eternal species. For the succitate reasons I started to believe that the food industry transformed us as a sort of dopamine slaves.Now that our diet has been perfected, we can talk about what I think is the icing on the cake. Ok, now what about using our enemy as our ally. Using the neurochemical interactions in our favor and not as our masters. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov \u201cacute exercise-induced changes in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, striatum, and cerebellum suggest a more pervasive effect, including improvements in long-term memory, recollection [270], reward-based learning [271, 272], and motor functions [273].\u201d \u201cAs exercise is repeated in a regular fashion over time, the brain changes illustrated in Fig. 1 will not only recur on a regular basis, but will also likely engage a variety of feedback, compensatory, and long-term, plasticity-based brain mechanisms. These changes may modulate these acute effects over time, resulting in modifications in baseline neurochemical levels that could lead to the long-term structural/anatomical and physiological changes that have been described following long-term increases in exercise.\u201d \u201cThis information will aid our ability to utilize exercise not only as a therapeutic tool to help delay, prevent, or treat cognitive decline in aging individuals, but also to use it as a powerful tool to enhance brain functioning in healthy individuals. Indeed, one of the most important implications for the positive behavioral effects of a single bout of exercise is the exciting potential for acute exercise to not only address conditions where attention and mood may be compromised (e.g., aging, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression), but also to enhance attention, mood, and stress resistance in normal populations.\u201d Dopamine works as a rewards system of our body, in other words it gives us a god like feeling if we can unlock it in a healthy manner, but there are two sides: you can cheat and reach instantly the god mode through videogame, social, sugar, cigarettes, cocaine or you can become a real god through sacrifice and a stabile sensation of well being and self satisfaction through costancy, nutrition and regular exercise. You have to define your lifestyle following a virtuous cycle where dopamine is used to reward your brain and feel great feelings only if you accomplish healthy steps in your journey. If we want a strong society, the current path followed by a good portion of the western population is a recipe for disaster. \u201cConsumption of rewards (e.g., palatable food, mating, cocaine) produces hedonic consequences which initiate learning processes that consolidate liking the rewarding goal. Motivational states such as hunger, sexual arousal, and perhaps early symptoms of drug withdrawal increase the incentive salience of reward-related cues and the reward itself. The greater the hunger, the greater the likelihood that behavioral sequences aimed at obtaining food will be initiated and carried to conclusion despite distractions and obstacles that may arise. \u201c ncbi.nlm.nih.gov mTOR \u201cAccordingly, mTOR has been implicated in many of the processes that are associated with aging, including cellular senescence, immune responses, cell stem regulation, autophagy, mitochondrial function, and protein homeostasis (proteostasis) 3, 8\u2013 10. Finally, in some model organisms, interventions expanding life span (for example, caloric restriction, or CR) were shown to involve TOR 3. This article provides an overview of the role of mTOR signaling in coordinating cellular processes involved in regulation of life span, aging, and age-related pathologies and puts an emphasis on mammals.\u201d ncbi.nlm.nih.gov \u201cWhen amino acids are available, mTOR springs into action and turns on the production of proteins in the cell. However, when amino acids are scarce, mTOR turns off, which slows down protein production and causes the cell to begin scavenging amino acids by digesting parts of itself.\u201d ncbi.nlm.nih.gov What seems at glance a bad effect is in reality one of the main good effects of fasting, \u201cSpecifically, in premalignant lesions, considerable evidence suggests that activation of autophagy might prevent cancer development [118].\u201d (pree-KAN-seh-rus) A term used to describe a condition that may (or is likely to) become cancer. Also called premalignant. source: cancer.gov \u201cTo date, pharmacological induction of autophagy through mTOR inhibition or AMPK activation has been shown to have some therapeutic and prevention potential in cancer \u201c ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Genes the new divinity to fear. Sometimes when it comes to tumors we start thinking \u201cunfortunately it depends on genes\u201d, or at least that is what I often hear from my interlocutor when I start talking about nutrition. It seems like when cyclically at some point in the history of our species, when something inexplicable happened we blamed some sort of divinity, maybe we understood that the position of stars in some way had a connection with the result of our harvest. Hence our first reflection was \u201cok, stars are gods, if something went wrong it is because our gods are angry with us\u201d. In other words we understand that stars and the harvest are connected but we have developed a flawed narrative based on the assumption available to us in that time frame. The narrative fills the gap between our lack of understanding of the world and reality; we must be open minded and accept uncertainty. Genes or environment (habits)? Your lifespan is only 20% genetic. The rest is up to you. Take your epigenome into your own hands. Here\u2019s an excellent article @nature and it\u2019s free. https://t.co/itolGeh0Wm pic.twitter.com/KsKJKgE1Bu\u2014 David Sinclair (@davidasinclair) September 13, 2019 I hope with my article to clarify the fact that we have room for maneuver when it comes to health and life span. And again\u2026 capitalism and sick incentives.. What did food industries do in order to adapt to an environment where people are interested in looking good? Tons of products with added Proteins and Amino Acids, they sell the illusion that if your snack is full of protein then it is healthy, instead it seems that an excess of amino acids is negatively correlated to our longevity. We evolved in a scarce ecosystem, thus our body is wired to eat whenever there is an occasion and in the meantime we, as a society, developed an ecosystem of abundance but our body still signals to us to eat as much as possible because there is uncertainty about the fact to be able to eat tomorrow in a natural environment. The current reality is that we have an abundance of food and our goal is to live long and healthy and not necessarily survive for a week. We can fast, obtain the benefit of fasting and be sure that the next day we can be correctly fed. Are there alternatives? Yeah, the incentives depend on the single components of our society, if knowledge spreads as a meme and we decide to be healthier, we can do it and we can claim a healthy support from the market. If you can create little tribes where the incentives are healthy aligned we can create a community which can efficiently compete inside a dynamic system and become stronger overtime, obtain resources and grow more strong and spread the healthy memes which can change our world. \u201cThe world\u2019s major cultures \u2013 including nations, languages, philosophical and artistic movements, social traditions and religions \u2013have been created incrementally over hundreds or even thousands of years. Most of the ideas that define them, including the inexplicit ones, have a long history of being passed from one person to another. That makes these ideas memes \u2013 ideas that are replicators.\u201d David Deutsch We deserve better memes but a meme works only if it provokes an action. Then start now to take responsibility for your health. Steroids and drugs I start my essay speaking about the importance of the mind, I want to reiterate this concept. If your focus is on the apparence, you will inevitably end up taking some shortcuts, for example roids. What\u2019s the problem with roids? Leaving aside the illegality of their assumption, if we don\u2019t properly understand how our ancestral body works and how every part interacts in a holistic manner, we will end using some short cut to reach the wrong goal, that is the apparence. As we saw, this stability is given by a deep understanding of the functionality of our body, hormones, insulin, autophagy, \u2026 With roids you\u2019ll still be ignorant. You don\u2019t learn how your body works and that short cut will prevent your knowledge from growing and appreciating the positive and reinforcing adjuncts on your well being compared to a correct and well built nutrition. You will stick to the appearance which is not the goal. APPEARANCE isn\u2019t the goal but only the litmus people, that we really want is mental wellbeing, clarity and stability. Appearance is a reward. These awards aren\u2019t donated but are the results of the holistic understanding of our body and how it interacts with our ecosystem. A simple example is the Growth Hormone, where if your body is put in the condition to produce it in a balanced way (endogenous) , you will be more healthy. If you intake it through injections (exogenous) you put yourself at risk to develop or enhance the ability of tumoral cells to grow in an uncontrolled way. With roids we fool ourselves, losing the ability to read our litmus paper correctly, and we are fooling our body, bringing our body to some real health risks. \u201cFurthermore, easily accessible and commonly diffused AAS [Anabolic Steroids], such as nandrolone and stanozolol, have the potential to induce and cause progression of particular kinds of cancer, such as Leydig cell tumor through multiple processes pathways.\u201d ncbi.nlm.nih.gov I prefer the idea of giving our body the instrument to be efficient and properly produce the exact mix needed to do my best. Fasting \u201cI fast for greater physical and mental efficiency\u201d Plato In the age of abundance, scarcity is the way to improve the efficiency of an anti-fragile system. For 2 years I regularly practiced a fasting routine of 24 hours every week, I want to immediately warn the reader that fasting is a practice that in my opinion comes only after a perfected diet has been put in place, when your body is correctly fed then you can start thinking about fasting, other than that I suggest you contact your doctor and ask him about any doubt, this is not medical advice. I started this practice because it was suggested by many people I follow and I respect. I strive to be open minded and I like to experiment on myself with new ideas to enhance my life experience and maybe even extend it in a healthy condition. What\u2019s the benefits? Autophagy \u201cWe conclude that both fasting and CR [Caloric Restriction] have a role in the upregulation of autophagy, the evidence overwhelmingly suggesting that autophagy is induced in a wide variety of tissues and organs in response to food deprivation. \u201c \u201cIn conclusion, energy restriction, regardless of the pattern of restriction, may influence memory function possibly through modulating AHN with the potential to be used as an intervention to prevent or boost cognitive decline.\u201d pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Neurogenesis \u201cThese findings suggest that IF [Intermittent fasting] may increase hippocampal neurogenesis involving the Notch 1 pathway.\u201c ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Running I added this point, even if related to training because it underline the synergic power of diet+training \u201cExercise is a simple intervention that profoundly benefits cognition. In rodents, running increases neurogenesis in the hippocampus, a brain area important for memory.\u201d ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Insulin sensibility \u201cThese results indicate that Ramadan fasting in young healthy individuals has a positive impact on the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.\u201d ncbi.nlm.nih.gov HGH production improved \u201cFasting also resulted in a progressive increase in mean GH pulse frequency and maximal pulse amplitude. The mean number of peaks per 24 h increased from 5.8\u00b10.7 to 7.3\u00b10.6 (P < 0.004) on the first fasted day and to 9.9\u00b10.7 (P < 0.03) on the fifth fasted day. There was also a significant increase in the mean maximal GH peak amplitude between the control day (5.9\u00b11.1 ng/ml) and the first fasted day (13.1\u00b11.2 ng/ml, P = 0.003) and the fifth fasted day (12.3\u00b11.6 ng/ml, P = 0.005). ncbi.nlm.nih.gov \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill you, makes you stronger.\u201d Friederich Nietzsche FIg 10. Phoenix source: wikipedia Greeks had given us another great symbolism about rebirth. Fasting is a homeostatic effort which improves our antifragile system (antifragility article), as the phoenix has to die in order to rebirth even stronger. During fasting your body will give you signals of surrender, as is always the case when homeostasis is tested, but if you survive from a psychological standpoint you will rebirth stronger. Warning: educate yourself about the importance of electrolytes and risks tied to fasting before starting this practice, tell your intentions to your doctor and understand that fasting will test your body which will surely rebel against your decision to deprive it of food. Supplements evolution I leave supplements as the last point because I think it is worth taking a supplement only if our diet is perfectly balanced, then some vitamins could help where our nutrition lacks completeness.If we discover the fire (thanks Prometheus), and this technology gives us a competitive advantage, why not use technology to develop tools to further unload our digestive system and in the meantime improve the range of micronutrients we absorb. I personally limit myself to the intake of a qualitative multivitamin, there are tons in commerce, find the best one and add it to a complete diet. In this sense I appreciated the letters of the CEO of one of those supplements company (Not affiliated) \u201cDespite all prevailing evidence and studies showing that many chronic diseases are preventable if early action is taken, our healthcare system has chosen to focus on the most expensive way to treat people \u2013 a focus on sick-care rather than well-care. The COVID-19 pandemic shone a bright light on the inefficiencies and inadequacies of our healthcare system. Relying on treating disease rather than trying to prevent it in the first place resulted in hundreds of thousands of potentially preventable deaths, as so many people had comorbidities that dramatically heightened the risk and impact of COVID- 19.\u201d Paul Jacobson Fight against social proof and start giving the correct fuel to our organic machine is the starting point in the transhuman journey. I hope to have given some tools to the citizens of the network and state some actionable tips in order to improve their physical and mental performance. Unfortunately a lot the research I quoted in my article end with the phrase \u201cmore research is needed\u201d Why are we not accelerating this kind of research? Why do we prefer to spend money on unhealthy projects? Why if a project is not aligned with the interests of some food corporation we don\u2019t properly fund it? My hope is that a network of smart people will pool capital in order to finance a better future for our species. I have to admit that I cherry picked some research because it was in line with my main thesis. I suggest you read the whole thing I linked and you research. Some topics are conflictual and not yet settled. Ok now, some practical datas I\u2019m a male1.83m80 kg36 yo Fig 11. Proof of WorkOut I had regularly practiced a vast range of sports but in the last chapter of my improvement journey I follow the following routine: Stretching \u2013 weightlifting \u2013 running I regularly lift weights and run 10 km in hypoglycemic conditions during my fasting (not a suggestion, it could be dangerous) My personal diet, not a suggestion, I\u2019m not a doctor. It tooks me year to create my personal diet on the bases of my researches Morning Oat, yogurt, milk, cacao, peanut butter, honey, banana +multivit Snack Eggs, avocado, cheese, olive oil, garlic (post Workout variant: eggs white + honey + berries) Lunch brown rice / wholemeal flatbread with some protein sources, vegetables a fruit snack wholemeal flatbread with some proteins sources, nuts dinner proteins sources, vegetables I drink only water and sometimes some herbal teas such as for example: white tea, chamomile, Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), .. As you can see I sometimes eat some honey, specifically in the two specific moments of the day where presumably the glucose reserves are depleted and your insulin sensitivity is at its best and able to make good use of the glucose. Fasting24h 1/week Last meal dinner 24h Only water, tons of water! (electrolytes if needed) first meal dinner I usually break the fast with a protein meal I have voluntarily avoided specifying the measures. What I wanted to highlight was the distribution of my meals ( there are numerous theories but at the moment this program is the best for my body, the secret is be curious and try new combinations, in fact I\u2019m open to suggestions from my readers). In general I try to eat the least amount possible and more quality foods, and it works greatly for me, sometimes I voluntarily skip some meals. Quality over quantity works well for me. I repeat this point: I find that one of the greatest secrets in a society of overfeeding is to train our body to survive with less food. You will discover that your body will become more energetic and you will raise your metabolism and your limits. Superfood I don\u2019t truly like this term but I noticed over time that some foods are more nutritious than others and I prefer to eat them every day as a natural supplement. Garlic Avocado Eggs Banana: What I\u2019d like to call: \u201cPerfect natural balanced supplement\u201d Nuts Berries Flavor Pay attention to another aberration of our society, that is flavor. The food industry in order to maximize their profits tend to push flavor instead of the food, for example yogurt with blueberry flavor. Blueberries are an incredible source of antioxidants. We don\u2019t need the \u201cflavor\u201d, we need tons of them every day. What I avoid (sometimes I make some exception to the rule) Sugar AlcoolBeer, hop is a phytoestrogens, then if you think to be a true man because you consume liters of beer, your endocrinologist would probably disagree If I can analyze a food and understand how much nutrients it contains. Why would I choose poor food? Why would I fill my stomach and why would I commit my digestion system with an inefficient vector of nutrients? Probably it is better to eat less but with high nutrient and high quality foods. Now, about our society \u201cThe object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.\u201d Marcus Aurelius What I see around me are people who do the exactly wrong thing. Why? Because our lazy society sells us unnatural physical models, junk foods, and roids. What I see around me are people who eat ton of sugars, takes roids to be in line with the model offers by our society and eat foods with artificial sweeteners and tons of proteines to feel \u201chealthy\u201d, exactly the counter productive path to reach what should be the goal of everyone, an healthy and extend life. Key point A clearer mind is the true goal! Sugar is the enemy, even if you cut it you alway have too much of it. Eat less but good quality. TAKE ACTION! Be part of the change, fight against society and spread knowledge, be an example for others, lead the pack!

Beach & Lemon Drinks Why a lemon drink and a paradisiac beach? Because at the end of this journey, we will meet together on an exotic beach as digital nomads, enjoying the dividends of our companies. Am I joking? Every great adventure contains a treasure to discover, risks, and a good dose of uncertainty. I cannot tell you the outcome, indeed the thrill you will feel is named uncertainty. By the way, the lemonade metaphor will be more clear during the reading of the article. Enjoy the next step of our adventure\u2026 What are we going to learn? The logic behind the price The formula of intrinsic value The convergence between value and price Email Address Here we are, it\u2019s time to take all the knowledge we have digested until now (Blog Index), and put it to work to define a price. Even if nowadays, the price seems a secondary feature with respect to the decision of buying a security, it\u2019s always been and it always will be the crux of the matter. At the end of the day, it\u2019s always a question of price. At the right price every asset could be a buy. I tend to agree with the last years of the investing practice of Buffett: \u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u201d Warren Buffett This is because at the start of his career Buffett followed the preach of his teacher Graham, which developed his reasoning during the \u201829 crisis, and he was focused on companies discounted in respect of their tangible assets. Sometimes even defined by Graham as \u201ccigar butt\u201d, heavily discounted companies in regard to their tangible assets at the point that the value of the assets itself was greater than the price of the security. Then in a liquidation event (bankruptcy), the investor would have received back the proceeds of the fire sale (only after bondholders). Today, especially in the developed market, we rely on services and technologies which are asset-light businesses. What does the switch from asset heavy to asset light means? Book value (the value of the assets found on the balance sheet) are less valuable in respect to the past. Today we have companies with a high barrier to entry, a powerful brand with mindshare and strong network effects, which produce high profit with less assets. Think about that, if I have a strong intellectual property as a new superhero character named DScompounding, if this superhero has a digital platform of distribution with network effect (e.g. Netflix) with the superpower of the \u201ccompounding effect\u201d, it can replicate itself over the planet through every device of the Netflix network, as for example your phone, the phone of your friends. But what is the cost of the product? There is a cost of related to the character creation, its advertisement, and the cost of technically realizing the platform of distribution, but today with cloud this costs can be minimized and, if I can reach scale with my platform, the cost of another copy of my movie with Dscompounding Superhero will be approximately ZERO, this give me earnings power even if I can maintain a low price because the cost of distribution is low. In other words, our world becomes less Atoms and more Bits, our digitalization as a species reduces the cost of our entertainment (deflation), because Bits are replicable (leaving aside Bitcoin, this is another interesting story, for another interesting article, think about Digital Scarcity, we will return on this topic). Why this apparent deviation? I wanted to highlight the importance of Cash generation over Book value. \u201cIt is important to understand, however, that the two terms \u2014 book value and intrinsic business value \u2014 have very different meanings. Book value is an accounting concept, recording the accumulated financial input from both contributed capital and retained earnings. Intrinsic business value is an economic concept, estimating future cash output discounted to present value. Book value tells you what has been put in; intrinsic business value estimates what can be taken out.\u201d Warren Buffet Discounted Cash Flow Formula But, don\u2019t fool yourself, the math I am going to analyze is only a basic equation explained first by John Burr Williams in his book \u201cThe Theory of Investment Value\u201d published in 1938, and then elaborated by Warren Buffett and other great investors of our times, isn\u2019t rocket science. Fig 2. Discount Cash Flow Formula source: The Theory of Investment Value, John Burr Williams, 1938 As you can see, the formula is very simple. The logic behind is better explained by a simple example. Imagine you built a lemonade stand near a beautiful beach in some exotic country. As we have seen in the last article a business has some costs related to the activity. Some of this depends directly on the production of the lemon juice (COGS) for example the lemon itself, but even commodities such as the sugar. Then you have to pay the stand where you produce the drink, the land where your activity stands, the machinery to squeeze the lemons. What you will gain depends on how much lemon juice you sell (Revenue), how much you pay to your supplier for the commodities you use in order to manufacture the product (lemon, sugar), how much you will pay to buy/rent the land where your juice factory stands, and how much it will cost to then buy and replace the squeeze machinery (depreciation). In the end, your profit depends if customers come to your stand or to a competitor one. Then, you have to have good marketing to build a brand (mindshare) and good relations with your supplier, maybe thanks to economies of scale, and thus get the lemon for a better price than competitors. If everything works for the better, you will soon start building new lemon stands around the globe and you will need to hire new staff and employ someone who will manage the company for you. You will get the profit as an owner, and in the meantime you can sunbathe at the beach instead of working at the stand. This is a simplified summary of what we had seen until now. \u201cWhy Stocks Go Up and Down\u201d by William H. Pike is a great book to deepen the subject (Books) Now, what if you want to sell the ownership of the lemonade international enterprise? At what price do you sell it? Or, in our case as value investors, at what price will we buy it? Note: A Moat is imperative to ensure the realization of the future cash flow, the Moat is what gives us some degree of certainty about the future cash. Without a competitive advantage our margin is threatened and the future cash flow with it. (14. It\u2019s a War) For that reason, this blog isn\u2019t just about a simple formula, but the formula we discovered today is only a piece of the grand scheme of things. As explained by Buffett \u201c [\u2026] the formula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by a very smart man in about 600 B.C. (though he wasn\u2019t smart enough to know it was 600 B.C.). The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, investment insight was \u2018a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\u2019 To flesh out this principle, you must answer only three questions. How certain are you that there are indeed birds in the bush? When will they emerge and how many will there be? What is the risk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)? If you can answer these three questions, you will know the maximum value of the bush\u2014 and the maximum number of the birds you now possess that should be offered for it. And, of course, don\u2019t literally think of birds. Think dollars.\u201d Warren Buffett Buffett\u2019s quote implied a series of notion: Time Value of Money = a sum of money in the hand as a greater value than the same sum to be paid in the future. The implied uncertainty of the future discounts the value of tomorrow\u2019s money. Opportunity cost = a more compelling opportunity arises, for example a company with a better price, or more simply, the business you are currently valuing doesn\u2019t grant you a good rate of return in the next few years, maybe because the price is too high, then a US treasury (known for its absence of risks = risk free) is a better alternative. We can restate the first formula now with a better understanding Fig 3. Formula There are some details we have to add to properly understand it. Free Cash Flow was treated in the last article (17. Cash Flow Statement Analysis). Required rate cant be explained simply by how much compounded rate of return we will obtain over a period of time by our investment (6. The eighth marvel of the world). There is not much to add. There are some notorious investors, for example, which they mentally do this calculation or some others which use some shortcut like for example P/E or EV/EBIT. These metrics are named as relative valuation tools, because they are used to compare different investments. Relative valuation looks more simple at glance, the trick is that in these simplified relationships between financial numbers you imply some underlying numbers without clearly expressing them. We will see in the Python code the number of assumptions we have to define in order to obtain the intrinsic value. As we know, the future is inherently uncertain, then every assumption is an error node in our process to reach the range of possible intrinsic value. Mauboussin suggests that given that the stock price is known, we can use a reverse DCF, reversing it to understand what assumptions the market implies in the stock price and if our assumptions are more or less optimistic. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, instead, is part of the tools named Absolute valuation. What\u2019s the difference? As I explained, the risk free rate used as a comparative hurdle in order to discount the cash flow is highly dependable by the US Treasury. Then if the US Treasury rate changes, the valuation of the whole market changes, thus the multiples (e.g P/E) will decrease. This is the consequence of the variable change in the DCF model of the investor involved in the market which defines the price in relation to the opportunities costs, defined at the end by the Federal Reserve through the interest rate (short explanation, not detailed because beyond the meaning of this blog). If we use a DCF we are forced to make explicit some variables. Sounds complex to understand? When something seems complex it means it is a good thing to code it in order to deepen our understanding. \u201cIf you can\u2019t program it, you haven\u2019t understood it.\u201d David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity I use Python as a language, I\u2019m a novice with this programming language, then if someone in the audience is a seasoned coder, could find my code trivial, at the same time I think is a good way to explain, and it gives room to add more features over time, thanks to useful library which maybe will be analyze in future articles. My final goal with this blog will be to converge my financial knowledge with my coding interest and create value in a shared platform (clue: Cryptocurrencies). But, for now, we will start from the basics in order to build solid knowledge. Is it possible to do it through an excel sheet? Yes, it\u2019s a simple formula, every Turing Machine can compute it, even your brain itself (the book \u201cRule1\u201d by Phil Town explains some tricks in this sense ( Books)). Python Here the Github link to the code: https://github.com/Dave86ch/ The code needs a spreadsheet and it is set up to upload the excel file from: https://roic.ai/ Follow the instruction of the site to obtain the free access to financial data (I\u2019ve no connection with the team behind the site but I find it useful for the purpose of my DCF). # Every section is introduced by an hashtag title with a description and a link to the blog article dealing with the topic. Fig. 4 BABA result example with DScompounding_DCF1.0 https://github.com/Dave86ch/ on Jupyter Note Please Note: My initial purpose was to share the code through google Colabotory (https://colab.research.google.com/), unfortunately something wrong happens and the code doesn\u2019t work anymore on this platform. You can simply copy and run the code in your favorite IDE (I used Jupyter Note). If I understand what goes wrong with google Collaboratory I will update the article with a link to Colab, I\u2019m open to receive suggestions by more savvy coders. You can use my code to make some changes and experimenting with your companies. Warning: this code isn\u2019t meant to be brainless, it\u2019s the code version of what we have learned until now, a journey through the math behind our story. As you can see, it\u2019s all about forecasting the future, with a huge weight towards the terminal value that is the perpetual growth into the future, yes I know, it\u2019s a strange approximation. Remember before starting to make assumptions \u201cFor superforecasters, beliefs are hypotheses to be tested, not treasures to be guarded.\u201d Philip Tetlock, Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction From this deconstruction we can extrapolate some variables worth noticing: Growth rate: Product Mindshare (Brand) Op margin: Management ability to reduce the expenses and razionalize the costs Gross margin: Mindshare Bargaining power with suppliers Change in share number: Issuance of stocks vs repurchases of stocks (Case Study 2 \u2013 Berkshire Hathaway) Management capital allocation Other than that, we understand the role of debt (Balance Sheet). High debt means high costs tied to servicing this debt which implies a reduction of the free cash flow. Deleveraging (reduction of the debt burden) could be a great sign for a company, it means free up some cash that increases the cash flow and consequently the intrinsic value. Sell some unprofitable branches or subsidiaries of the business which dilutes the cash generated by the profitables one, as said by Munger and quoted by Nicholas Sleep: \u201cSouter began cutting away the weak businesses, a process Charlie Munger, vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway refers to as the \u201ccancer surgery approach\u201d. This often works because there is normally a jewel at the heart of most companies that has often been used to fund new ventures or is taken for granted by impatient management. As the jewel becomes diluted by less successful projects aggregate performance declines and valuations atrophy or even fall.\u201d Nicholas Sleep (The Mentors: Nomad Letters quotes) When we discover the basic figures involved in the equation, we can create a series of hypotheses and the combination between those in order to define a range of price and better understand what in the future could happen and change our thesis. What the deconstruction of the DCF analysis tell us, is the importance of qualitative factors, in other words \u201cThe story\u201d, indeed the meaning of the qualitative side of the analysis is exactly that: tell us a story which pave the way for the number emergence and survival over the duration of our forecast. The precision of the future numbers aren\u2019t that important, what really matters is the existence of a story which preserves the Moat and consequently permits those numbers to emerge in some way. For that reason I\u2019m searching for a simple and profitable business with solid Moats, less assumptions mean a more forecastable feature. \u201cNumbers alone won\u2019t tell you the answer; instead you must think critically about the qualitative characteristics of your business.\u201d Peter Thiel, Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future Fig 5. Damodaran scheme Relation between Value and Price Until now we have analyzed the Value of our stock, we already have discussed the notion of Moat, we had dug through the financial statements all of this in order to try to hypothesize the future cash flow of our company. But, the ultimate goal of our efforts is to buy a company which will appreciate in the future, then we need a discount in respect to the current price. To enjoy this appreciation we have to buy it undervalued and sell it when the price converges with our estimate. How that happens? Here prof Ben Graham helps us: \u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine.\u201d Benjamin Graham In the short run, as greatly explained by the fig. Momentum and mood, group thinking and liquidity (liquidity: it\u2019s the stock easily tradable? Or maybe, because of its size, it\u2019s difficult to buy the stock without affecting the volatility?). In other words, our psychology and Mr Market (8. Mr Market) psychology affects the price. But as explained by Graham, over the long term (PATIENCE!!!) the price reverts to the value of the underlying business. I have a suggestion from Mark Twain. It\u2019s a simple phrase but I suggest you think about it, write it down somewhere and reread it when panic arises and you see users on investing forums, your neighbors, your parents, your colleagues start thinking all in the same way, as a herd of lemmings (herd mentality, yes we are animals and our tribes and societies are herds.). \u201cWhenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.\u201d Mark Twain And be careful even when some great investors start panicking, maybe there is some reason you don\u2019t know. Think before acting, even if your favorite investor does something that scares you. The words \u201cIt\u2019s going to zero along with every other hotel company in the world. \u2026 Every hotel is going to be shut down in the country. Everyone,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cAgain, I\u2019m a major shareholder. [But] if we allow this to continue the way we allow it to continue, every hotel company in the world is done.\u201d Bill Ackman The actions \u201cPershing Square manager Bill Ackman turned a net profit of more than $2 billion on Monday after he sold his bets against the market less than one week after warning CNBC that \u201chell is coming\u201d and imploring the White House to shut down the country for a month He then used those proceeds to wager that existing Pershing bets, including hotel operator Hilton Worldwide, would rebound.\u201d source: CNBC Think about it. Catalysts The catalysts are events which bring the Market to evaluate a stock multiple (How much I want to pay for the current/future earnings of this business? Aka P/E). I personally concentrate my effort on great businesses which compound their cash flow, then the cash flow growth is the catalyst. A good management manages to realize the value through investment with high ROIC, buybacks and special dividends (non-recurring distribution of company assets). \u201cMr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to either ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence. Indeed, if you aren\u2019t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don\u2019t belong in the game. As they say in poker, \u201cIf you\u2019ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don\u2019t know who the patsy is, you\u2019re the patsy.\u201d Benjamin Graham As Graham said, I try to use Mr. Market\u2019s mood to buy at great price, a good business will take care of itself and overtime earnings and cash flow will force the price to converge. As this image explains: Fig 6. Results Driver ROIC = Cash returns on investment People = Management aligned with shareholders and motivated employees. \u201cWe like to think we can predict the future and exercise a degree of control over powerful systems such as the weather and the economy. Yet the butterfly effect shows that we cannot. The systems around us are chaotic and entropic, prone to sudden change. For some kinds of systems, we can try to create favorable starting conditions and be mindful of the kinds of catalysts that might act on those conditions \u2013 but that\u2019s as far as our power extends. If we think that we can identify every catalyst and control or predict outcomes, we are only setting ourselves up for a fall.\u201d Farnam Street \u2013 \u201cThe Butterfly Effect: Everything You Need to Know About This Powerful Mental Model\u201d Indeed, I trust only one catalyst, a great business which generates tons of cash. I leave the rest of the madness to Mr. Market which gives me some great price to increase my portfolio positions. Fig 7. Apple Cash Flow CF convergence to Price, that\u2019s thanks to a management shareholder oriented which used Cash Flow to buybacks stocks creating the catalyst for share appreciation. Fig 8. Apple Price \u201cman muss immer umkehren\u201d (or loosely translated, \u201cinvert, always invert.\u201d) [German mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi] \u201c[Jacobi] knew that it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward,\u201d Munger Charlie What are Munger and Jacobi trying to explain here? As we have seen, some parameters of our business define the price we should\u2019ve been willing to pay. This is the forward linear: Variables \u2192 Price. But what if we use the same formula backwards? Price \u2192 Variables. In other words, play with our formula and try to understand what Mr. Market is implying with the price today. This could give us some insight about the variables and forecasts implied by the market, which could help us to understand the environment. At the end of the day it\u2019s all about uncertainty. To rephrase it, when we invest, we are betting on the future and we are trying to protect ourselves by spotting flaws in our cognitive process. Margin of Safety I want to briefly introduce this notion, I will dig into it in a future article, but I feel the need to give you this tool. Now you are ready to look around and search for bargains to buy within your range of fair value. The assumptions used are uncertain therefore the prices are ballpark figures and not precise. For that reason it\u2019s important to understand the notion of Margin of Safety, Seth Klarman wrote a book on it, then I can\u2019t condense the entire idea in a few words, but the basic idea is to buy with a buffer that takes care of uncertainty and errors tied to our calculation. We as investors discount the price to preserve/ protect ourselves from our own ignorance. This can be likened to a bridge that is built to support more weight than permitted by the technical specification, despite having to remain solid if, by chance or in error, an overweight truck passes over it. Yes, we are ignorant and sometimes arrogant, neglect it could be dangerous. Fig 9. Margin of safety \u201cA margin of safety is necessary because valuation is an imprecise art, the future is unpredictable, and investors are human and do make mistakes. It is adherence to the concept of a margin of safety that best distinguishes value investors from all others, who are not as concerned about loss.\u201d\u201d Seth Klarman A margin of 5%? 10%? 20%? This is up to you and the story you have created.

The Hero\u2019s Journey Joseph Campbell , source: Wikipedia \u201cInvesting is a wonderful, thoughtful, adventure but it can also be self-centered, a tendency that can be reinforced by the wealth that can follow. We think it is true that, once past X-amount, real meaning comes with reinvesting in society through charitable giving, which can also be a thoughtful, challenging, wonderful adventure, but with the added bonus that it feels like the world working properly. We hope that you can join us.\u201d Nicholas Sleep and Qais Zakaria, 2021. I just finished reading the entire saga of Nomad Partnership (From 2001 to 2013 Nomad returned 20.8% CAGR before fee). It was an amazing avventure, worth the time reading the 218 pages which compose the letters written by Nicholas \u201cNick\u201d Sleep during his adventure. Avventure is the word Sleep uses often describing his journey through 13 years of investing. To contextualize, Nick and Zak were early investors in Costco and Amazon. These letters were written every six months, from the end of 2001 to early 2014, and sent to Partners in the Nomad Investment Partnership. The fund through this period generated a wealth of 2bn USD. I suggest you read the entire collection in order to appreciate the deep meaning of the investing journey. Email Address This discipline goes beyond the simple research of money, but it encompasses the whole spectrum of human existence, passing through psychology, history, charity, adventure and discovery. Nick Sleep itself named it as \u201cOur adventures in capitalism\u201d. Sometimes we research adventure in sci-fi movies or Netflix series, on top of that I find this a more interesting adventure, an adventure into the real world, an adventure which puts yourself to become a better thinker and more knowledgeable about our reality. Free market, in this sense, is a feedback machine. We use our brain to formulate hypotheses, and the market assesses our hypothesis. Like all adventures, an adventure hides dangers, but even great opportunities to become free and enlightened, more creative, and more productive. Free time for yourself, over and above that, for our family and for the entire humanity. The purpose of this blog is to journal my personal adventure, as a diary, where I share what I learn, and the path I trace. Charity and philanthropy are always capital allocation activities, as they are investing in the stock market, but oriented to humanitarian purposes. As in the Sleeps\u2019 case , indeed Nomad Partnership ended in 2014, and today Nick Sleep is active in the philanthropic field through the I.G. Foundation. In the investing section of their website you can find the entire collection of letters. The letters source: https://igyfoundation.org.uk/ I will try something unconventional, I will chronologically reverse the narrative, starting from the end to the beginning, because, as I explained in the blog, with a healthy goal in mind, it will become easier to forecast the bad days of our investing journey. THE GOAL \u201c\u2026we had what we needed, just a few superb businesses, and we were unlikely to sell any of those to fund the purchase of another cigar butt, Philippine cement company, were we? The pull was the prospect of independence and a new adventure, this time working out how to recycle the funds for others to benefit. We wound up at an age (mid 40s) when it forced us to build something new (you can\u2019t sit on the beach forever), and, hopefully, we would live long enough to also see the consequences of our actions; we would have to eat our own cooking, as it were. Previous generations that retired in old age and died soon after, have not always had that opportunity. As we said in the preamble, we have not entirely left investing behind either. \u2026 Investors can think their way to success without seeming to work in the traditional sense and the payoff in capitalism from stock picking can be extraordinary. It is one thing for capital allocators to be rewarded for their efforts but, in our opinion, taking personal identity in everything above X-amount is not a route to building a better world. We suspect that: if you made it to the end of our letters, then you are one of the good guys and know that already. If good investing is a minority sport, then good philanthropy is a minority sport for those that do minority sports. Our band could do with moving from the fringes of society to becoming the norm. We hope you will join us on the journey.\u201d Nomad Letters by Nicholas Sleep \u201cYou are the Hero of your own Story\u201d Joseph Campbell I rearranged the remaining key concepts in three main categories: Temptations: PSYCHOLOGY Herd Bias and Market Short Term Attitude \u201cThe hero is tempted to abandon or stray from his quest. Traditionally, this temptation is a love interest, but it can manifest itself in other forms as well, including fame or wealth.\u201d Margaret Atwood The Helper: PRINCIPLES Life and Investing Creativity and Thinking Wisdom and Self- Learning Behavior Value Investing Portfolio Management Global Diversification Cash Business Valuation Management Valuation \u201cA hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.\u201d Joseph Campbell The Helper\u2019s journey: CASES STUDY Amazon Costco Dell WalMart AirAsia Quotes from Nomad Partnership Letters by Nicholas Sleep and Qais Zakaria Every adventure begins with a protagonist who lives in the ordinary world, and receives a call to explore uncharted territories, full of risks and uncertainty. An seemingly impossible venture for a common man. For that reason the protagonist is usually helped by a mentor (The Helper) who gives him a light in the dark (Principles and Tools), and a dose of courage to abandon the herd and take responsibility for his own journey. Lastly the helper warns the protagonist about the journey\u2019s dangers (Temptations). There is a hero inside of everyone, and for everyone of us there are virtuous mentors. This article is dedicated to two of my heroes who became mentors, as a result of the accomplishment of their own adventures (Cases Study). \u201cIf I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants\u201d. Isaac Newton The next are thoughts and quotes written by Nicholas Sleep and categorized by me in a non-chronological order. Sometimes, you will find quotes of other great investors reported by Sleep in his letters, besides I inserted a few of my thoughts highlighted in italic font. Temptations: PSYCHOLOGY Herd bias and Market \u201cIf Zak and I bring something to the investment party, and I may be stretching things a little here, it is to be more rational than other investors. At least, we hope that is the case.\u201d \u201cSo, patience, social proof, vividness and probability-based thinking are the four psychological hurdles I have chosen to highlight and I think we understand these perhaps a little better than the average investor out there\u2026\u201d \u201cOne of the reasons that Nomad is Nomad is that Zak and I spend 213 almost no time thinking about stock market indices.\u201d \u201cFollowing what everyone else is doing may be hard to resist, but it is also unlikely to be associated with good investment results. Zak and I concentrate on the price to value ratio of the Partnership and ignore its performance as much as is practical, and we would encourage you to do the same.\u201d \u201cTraditional economists argue that people are rational beings who seek, what economists call, utility maximization, that is, the maximum output for any one input. This old guard are hostile to assertions of non-rational behavior, perhaps because the idea that we are all rational is just so elegant. Scientist and External SFI Professor W. Brian Arthur argues that this static, equilibrium-based model of the world does not sit easily with the biologist\u2019s view that individuals act in self-interest, make mistakes, learn and evolve. Or the psychologists\u2019 view of the world that there are systematic biases to individual decisions \u2013 that is, we have these little wobbles in our decision-making processes. Arthur describes the economy as a Complex Adaptive System that evolves as agents (people) learn.\u201d \u201c\u2026the dominant dynamic in the markets today [2002]: investment time frames are very compressed, and few investors it seems bother to assess the real value of a business but instead respond to the latest data point to determine share price direction. This is momentum investing and is the mechanism by which expensive shares become very expensive, just as cheap shares may become very cheap.\u201d \u201cWhen there is a frenzy of activity in one area of the market there is very often an anti- bubble of discarded companies. In the dot com era these were companies with steady cash flow\u201d \u201cWhen we wrote to you a year ago, we said, \u201cIt may not feel like it but for a long term investor this is the best of times not the worst [GFC 2008]\u2026Take heart and look to the horizon.\u201d Today we have a portfolio of exceptional, iconoclastic businesses that we could own for many years. \u201c \u201cCompanies often misclassify their mistakes in terms of outputs rather than inputs, and in so doing allow the original mistake to go unchecked. Psychologists call this denial, and we all do it to some extent. \u201c \u201cdenial, that is the reinvention of reality in the mind because the truth is too painful to bear; anchoring, that is a static, historic vision of a problem; and drift, that is how small, incremental changes in thinking build into a big mistake. Add judging to the list as well, in the sense of condemning or exalting: that disposition stops a lot of rational thought, and it is almost ubiquitous\u201d \u201cIt is not easy because there are so many distractions: news items, the soap opera of the stock market, macroeconomic events, politics, currencies, interest rates, principal/agent temptations, regulation, compliance, administration and so on \u2013 this list is not exhaustive! It is all too easy to make things more complicated than they need to be or, to invert, it is not easy to maintain discipline. One trick that Zak and I use when sieving the data that passes over our desks is to ask the question: does any of this make a meaningful difference to the relationship our businesses have with their customers?\u201d \u201ca greater risk to our businesses may come as a by-product of success \u2013 be it bubble valuations in the stock market and/or, political risk in the form of anti-trust like pressures. \u2026 the long-term risks our companies face are not those that dominate the newspapers and headlines today (credit crises, housing crises, budget crises, Euro crises and so on) but those events that could prevent them from reaching their potential.\u201c \u201cA word of warning: the current market [Dec 2004] is not like the end of the 1990s when a bubble in high priced mainly technology stocks was balanced with Zen like symmetry by an antibubble of cheap, slower growth business. Today, prices are evenly high across the various opportunity sets, and there are few readily apparent pockets of under-valuation of size. We particularly enjoyed an editorial in the Investor\u2019s Business Daily carried in December, which captures the mood of the markets quite well \u201cThe Fed tightens, stocks go up. The dollar falls, stocks go up. Oil soars, stocks go up. Retail sales wobble, stocks go up. Is this a great country or what?\u201d \u201cIt is probably fair to say that reinvestment risk (the risk from investing the incremental dollar poorly) is probably higher today than normal. But then, with the Partnership closed, we do not have many incremental dollars to reinvest. \u201c \u201cBill Miller argued that there are three competitive advantages in investing: informational (I know a meaningful fact nobody else does); analytical (I have cut up the public information to arrive at a superior conclusion) and psychological (that is to say, behavioural). Sustainable competitive advantages are usually a product of analytical and or psychological factors, and the overwhelming advantage with regard to Nomad is the patience of the investor base and the alignment of that disposition with the analytical and psychological traits of your manager. It simply would not work otherwise. In the investment objective section of the Nomad prospectus, we say that our job is to \u201cpass custody [of your investment] over at the right price and to the right people\u201d and that \u201cthe approach will require patience\u201d. That\u2019s what investing is, at least for us.\u201d \u201cwe have no idea where the market will end this year but given corporate strategies, capital allocation and starting valuations, I think we have some idea of how our companies will evolve over the next few years. In other words (at this point economics students may wish to cover their ears) the return from investing in shares can be both increased and de-risked by time.\u201d \u201cWell Brian Arthur at the Santa Fe Institute refers to the economy as a complex adaptive system that learns as agents learn. And that seems like a way better model to me\u2026 \u201c \u201cNon-transitive dice offer two handy investment models: first, just as any dice can win for a while, so any superiority an investment process may have will only emerge with time, so patience is important. Second, the stock market posts prices every day, this is the equivalent of making your opponent chose his dice first.\u201d \u201cIn a traditional capital cycle framework, the high valuation of these businesses encourages a supply side response, which eventually undermines the economics discounted in the stock price. \u2026 Indeed, human nature being as it is, we can almost guarantee that capital spending will continue to grow until share prices decline. \u2026 For such stocks to be a viable investment for Nomad we would have to feel confident that sector economics are not discounted in prices several years out and, given the rise in capital spending plans, that is not the way to bet. And this is Nomad\u2019s great strength. By looking out five years we do not have to invest in shorter-term phenomena in order to look good this year. And in our opinion that is at the heart of what is driving the frenzied trading in Phelps Dodge \u2013 the desire to look good this year, quarter, month, week, or just today. When there is a frenzy of activity in one area of the market there is very often an anti- bubble of discarded companies. In the dot com era these were companies with steady cash flow. \u201c \u201cOperating inside the bubble, it is hard for many participants to see this. The author Upton Sinclair, commenting on the attitude of businessmen and almost one hundred years to the day before the current credit crisis, had it about right, \u201cit is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary (or bonus) depends on his not understanding it\u201d. So, the mindset is prevalent because it pays in the short term. But this does not make it the right thing to do, nor does it make it profitable over the long-term. \u201c \u201cInvestors know that in time average companies fail, and so stocks are discounted for that risk. However, this discount is applied to all stocks even those that, in the end, do not fail. The shares of great companies can therefore be cheap, in some cases, for decades.\u201d \u201cThe insanity of bubble-like valuations was well captured by Scott McNealy in a 2002 interview in Business Week when he was still CEO of Sun Microsystems (source: James Montier, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Cross Asset Research Group), \u201cBut two years ago we were selling at ten times revenues when we were at U$64. At ten times revenues, to give you a ten-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for ten straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes that, with zero R&D for the next ten years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at U$64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don\u2019t need transparency. You don\u2019t need footnotes. What were you thinking?\u201d Short-Term attitude \u201cSo ,for example, the biggest mistake an investor can make is to sell a stock that goes on to rise ten -old! \u2018 not from owning something into bankruptcy. But that\u2019s what everyone thinks,\u201d \u201cIn previous Nomad letters we have argued that the biggest error an investor can make is the sale of a Wal-Mart or a Microsoft in the early stages of the company\u2019s growth. Mathematically this error is far greater than the equivalent sum invested in a firm that goes bankrupt. The industry tends to gloss over this fact, perhaps because opportunity costs go unrecorded in performance records.\u201d \u201c\u2026far better, Zak argues, to earn less, but for a much longer time\u201d \u201cIn our opinion, transient, historic, stock price quotation volatility is not the same as investment risk. Indeed, quite the opposite.\u201d Ed. Beta an academic gift to us \u201cAs ever, a stoic indifference to these short-term steps, both up and down, is the right way to think,\u201d \u201c At Marathon a full holding cycle can exceed 5 years, so any quarter individually considered could be poor without affecting long-term outcomes. For those keen on monthly results there will be 60 such data points in a full holding cycle. These data points, in the hands of an inexperienced investment committee, could be misconstrued or worse. After all, most of Marathon\u2019s client termination events occurred after, rather than before, a period of underperformance. This is clearly what can happen via the mark-to-market effects of quarterly reporting. The \u201cPavlovian\u201d association of poor short-term results with long-term incompetence and confusion between the two can lead to disastrous decisions.\u201d \u201cGood investing is a minority sport, which means that in order to earn returns better than everyone else we need to be doing things different to the crowd. And one of the things the crowd is not, is patient.\u201d \u201cWe can all do momentum investing, but it is emotional investing and I just don\u2019t think it is that intelligent, or profitable.\u201d \u201cImmediate gains are perceived positively compared to larger deferred gains as the limbic (survival) system has the ability to over-ride the fronto-parietal (analytical) system. Interestingly, stress induces this over-ride, and of course, money induces stress. So, the more stressed we are, the more we value short-term outcomes! This is not without reason, for if starving is a real possibility, a meal today is more important than a feast in a week\u2019s time, and the brain\u2019s wiring reflects that survival bias.\u201d \u201cThe quality of our research-based decisions overwhelmingly determines whether we will do well in the long run. But it has almost no influence over the timing of these results. Zak and I do not control the annual performance figures. It might be nice if we did. But we don\u2019t. \u201c \u201cThe lag that often exists between investment decision and eventual reward is a problem for long-term investors, as the brain is wired to learn from immediate feedback. The biological presumption (and, as mentioned in the last Nomad letter, the academic presumption too) is that cause and effect sit chronologically on top of each other \u2013 after all, you would want to know that the plant you have just eaten is poisonous now (so you can stop eating it) rather than in a week\u2019s time, when it would be too late.\u201d \u201cthe equity yield curve is a concept that argues that patience has a value, and that returns increase with time in the equity market as they do on a normal bond market yield curve.\u201d \u201cSo, the more stressed we are, the more we value short-term outcomes!\u201d \u201cAs a result, Keynes warned, the stock market would become \u2018a battle of wits to anticipate the basis of conventional valuation a few months hence rather than the prospective yield of an investment over a long term of years.\u2026Simply put, what went wrong was a pathological mutation in capitalism\u2014from traditional owners\u2019 capitalism, where the rewards of investing went primarily to those who put up the capital and took the risks\u2014to a new and virulent managers\u2019 capitalism, where an excessive share of the rewards of capital investment went to corporate managers and financial intermediaries.\u201d Jack Bogle \u201cWe have learned or, rather, come to appreciate, that the character of a firm \u2013 call it the ability to resist locker room temptation \u2013 is far more important than first we realised. This is an important insight. In the long run it may be all that matters. It is perhaps 170 the dominant, get-ahead mindset of our times and it is inherently focused on vivid, short term outputs. \u2026 This is an attitude whereby the players just have to win, and they are not too squeamish about the means. And if winning, for some, meant securing a bigger bonus than others, then, in the case of the mortgage market, any way to get people to buy expensive paper was just fine, and to hell with the consequences. This is a proud, manipulative, points-scoring orientation that manifests itself in all walks of life, but may be especially evident on Wall Street, although some salesmen, sportsmen, chief executives, politicians, warlords and hedge fund types are notably not exempt.\u201d \u201cAlternatively, the second way to invest is to buy shares in a great business at a reasonable price and let the business grow. This appears to require just one decision (to buy the shares) but, in reality, it requires daily decisions not to sell the shares as well! Almost no one does this, in part because it requires patience \u2013 and the locker room set does not do patience \u2013 but also because inactivity is the enemy of high fees.\u201d \u201c\u201cDon\u2019t just do something, stand there!\u201d The White Rabbit, Alice in Wonderland \u2026 The research continues but, as far as purchase or sale transactions in Nomad are concerned, we are inactive.\u201d \u201cInvestor Conference Bill Miller, whose investment skills we much admire, confessed to analysing his mistakes more thoroughly than his successes. The latter he automatically presumed to have gone up for the very reason the shares were bought. As investors we all do this to some extent, winners flatter the ego regardless of the reason they went up, whilst we all feel bad about the losers. Several academic studies argue that mistakes hurt up to three times more than gains satisfy, a product of primordial environmental conditioning designed to prevent us from repeatedly eating poisonous food, apparently. For investors the implication of this asymmetry is great as it is often the favorable outcomes that drive performance more than losers destroy it.\u201d The Helper: PRINCIPLES Life and Investing Creativity and thinking \u201cInvesting in stocks is an art\u201d Peter Lynch (11. Stories and Number) \u201cAfter a recent speech Gell-Mann was asked, \u201cSo, how do you have creative thinking?\u201d His answer was: 1. Start thinking about something, gather data to the point of saturation, recognise anomalies and recognise that you are now stuck; 2. Retreat and simmer, mull it over and a period of incubation ensues with the unconscious mind deployed; 3. Whilst doing something else a solution to the problem surfaces (Archimedes\u2019 eureka revelation); 4. Go and verify the new solution. To Gell-Mann, taking time is important in creative thinking.\u201d \u201cthe frontal cortex of the brain, which is charged with rational thought and information processing, can make more sense of the world, given enough time to think it through, than the senses themselves can make sense of the world. \u201c \u201cAnd then there are the differences, for instance information does not always have food-like quality standards. There is little-to-no labelling of information presented on television, so fact and fiction can be deliberately fused and have given rise to \u201cdocudramas\u201d and \u201cmocumentaries\u201d. In literature the same phenomenon exits and has been popularised following the success of books such as Dan Brown\u2019s \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d. To avoid confusion, one solution may be to label information for its fact content, in the same way we label food for its fat content. \u2026 Information, like food, has a sell by date, after all, next quarter\u2019s earnings are worthless after next quarter. And it is for this reason that the information that Zak and I weigh most heavily in thinking about a firm is that which has the longest shelf life, with the highest weighting going to information that is almost axiomatic: it is, in our opinion, the most valuable information. No doubt Charles Darwin would agree.\u201d Wisdom and self-learning \u201cDiscovery is one of the joys of life and, in our opinion, is one of the real thrills of the investment process. The cumulative learning that results leads to what Berkshire Hathaway Vice-Chairman Charlie Munger calls \u201cworldly wisdom\u201d. Worldly wisdom is a good phrase for the intellectual capital with which investment decisions are made and, at the end of the day, it is the source of any superior investment results we may enjoy.\u201d \u201cBehavioural Finance takes a pragmatic, multidisciplinary approach (a little like Geography!) and puts the rational economists\u2019 view of the world together with that of the psychologist and biologist. After all, how can economics not be behavioural.\u201d Behavior \u201cAs Darwin found, it is hard to let the facts speak for themselves, reject the established way of thinking and to do so in good conscience.\u201d \u201cit is not the money you have, but the choices you make, that count.\u201d \u201cGood things follow when you care about the pennies.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t care about the pennies anymore, that\u2019s why no one has got any money,\u201d \u201cWe keep our discussions to as high a level as we can manage in the belief that, in the long run, the high level is all that matters. In these letters we have therefore discussed business models, incentive compensation, capital allocation, mistakes, more mistakes, even more mistakes, lots on psychology and how to think, lots on attitude and so on.\u201c \u201cNassim Nicholas Taleb (author of \u201cFooled by Randomness\u201d) published an interesting paper (free, on the internet) which also linked the sequence in which returns occurred to how they made investors feel. He argued that investors often accept the risk of an occasional large loss for a steady small profit as the recurrence of the gains made them feel better. This occurred even when an opposite strategy, of steady small losses followed by a large gain, generated superior end results. Travelling comfortably dominates people\u2019s thinking when they should be thinking about destinations.\u201d \u201cAs a younger man I separated investing from the rest of my life, as if they were different worlds. This is a false construct. Another mistake. What we learn from home-life helps us be better investors, and what we learn as investors helps us be better husbands and fathers. In the end, all reality has to respect all other reality. And that\u2019s what a full life is all about. Thank you for your support. \u201c \u201cFrom time to time we swap slippers for brogues and head out into the world with the expectation that what we learn through investing helps us in other activities outside the office, and what we learn doing other activities helps us as investors.\u201d \u201cIf Nomad is to have a competitive advantage over our peers this will come from the capital allocation skills of your manager (if any) and the patience of our investor base. Only by looking further out than the short-term crowd can we expect to beat them. (The term patience appears 49 times in the letters)\u201d \u201c1.Misanalysis, or using the wrong mental model: Investors are used to firms which have one good idea, such as a new product, but then struggle to replicate success and end up diluting returns (Zak and I call this the Barbie problem, as Mattel has struggled to replicate the economics of its famous doll). Taking this model and applying it to Wal-Mart would miss the company\u2019s source of success entirely as the strategy of price givebacks did not change from year to year; culture plays a part in the continuity of a successful price giveback strategy and factors such as culture, because they are hard to quantify, often go undervalued by investors; 2. Structural or behavioral: Active fund managers have to look active. One way to do this is to sell Wal-Mart, which appeared expensive (but actually wasn\u2019t), to buy something that appeared cheaper (but err, also wasn\u2019t); investors are not long-term and did not look further than the next few years or, more recently, few quarters. Evidence for this can be gleaned from the average holding periods for shares which stands at just a few months; 3. Odds or incorrectly weighing the bet: In the words of my first boss, Empirical Research Partners, an investment research boutique, discovered that the chance of a growth stock keeping its status as a growth stock for five years is one in five, and for ten years just one in ten. On average, companies fail.\u201d \u201c[In the mid 1960\u2019s]\u201ca very famous collector, who has one of the finest noses for sniffing out a deal, hears a whisper that the first James Bond Aston Martin DB5 may be for sale\u2026The word is that for the right money, the original James Bond car can be bought directly from the movie studio. So he makes a few calls, he tracks down the production guy\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s gonna have to be 15 for the pair\u201d \u201cYou mean there are two?\u201d \u201cHey man this is show business, there is always two\u2026 at least\u201d \u201cBut 15 for the pair\u201d says our man. \u201cI wasn\u2019t counting on spending that much and I don\u2019t really want two \u2013 I just want one\u201d \u201cWhen that is the deal. Take it or leave it.\u201d \u2026\u201cFifteen thousand pounds \u2013 a lot of money now, a load of money then. Our hero hesitates for a moment, but his nose knows better. It tells him to deal. He buys the car. The cash is to be paid on delivery of both vehicles. The day arrives, the trailer pulls up, the cars roll off. The invoice reads: FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS. Yes, friends both original Bond cars for \u00a31500, but it does not end there. Be prepared to run for the hills screaming. Our man then swaps one of the Bond cars for a GTO. That\u2019s a GTO for \u00a3750. That\u2019s the cheapest GTO ever and\u2026he still has it today.\u201d \u2026 We are reminded of Winston Churchill\u2019s story of a man on his deathbed: I have had a lot of trouble in my life, says the dying man, most of which never happened. It may not feel like it but for a long-term 156 investor this is the best of times not the worst. It is in this environment that people sell their GTOs for \u00a3750. Take heart and look to the horizon.\u201d \u201cEven though consumers were being offered what seemed to Schwartz to be an ever-increasing plethora of choice to meet their needs, he could find no correlation with increased happiness. Instead, he hypothesised, that with all the choice came the (subconscious) expectation that the outcome ought to be perfect, and this expectation rendered the actual choice made as disappointing in comparison. It was as if too much choice was making us unhappy. \u2026 It is very easy, therefore, to feel unhappy about one\u2019s investments. Indeed, on any one day, month, year it is highly likely, indeed statistically almost certain, that one\u2019s chosen combination of investments will lag alternatives \u2013 there will always be someone who did better. In a recent Nomad letter (June 2010) we wrote\u2026 \u201cReaders that make it to the end of our letters (we may be flattering ourselves), including the footnotes (we may be deluding ourselves!), may recall the story we retold of the Ferrari 250 GTO bought by a collector in the 1960s for the effective price of \u00a3750. The beauty of the story is that although the car is one of the most valuable in the world, the collector still has his car today. A different 250 GTO has recently changed hands, and the price\u2026US$20m!\u201d Value Investing \u201cFinally, it is the long-term investor, he who most promotes the public interest, who will in practice come in for the most criticism, wherever investment funds are managed by committees or boards or banks. If he is successful, that will only confirm the general belief in his rashness; and if in the short run he is unsuccessful, which is very likely, he will not receive much mercy. Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.\u201d Source: The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money John Maynard Keynes \u201cAnd what did we learn in Investing 101 from Lord Keynes: \u201cbetter to be generally right than precisely wrong\u201d! At the time we were making these errors we would have held Keynes\u2019 quote as true. One has to be so careful; sometimes these mistakes are very insidious. Keynes\u2019 dying words were reported to be \u201cI should have had more champagne\u201d. No doubt he is right on both accounts. Destination analysis is consciously central to how we analyse businesses these days. It helps us ask better questions and get to a firm\u2019s DNA. What we learnt at Conseco may well have kept us out of the US banks last year, and what we learnt at Stagecoach has helped us continue to own Amazon\u201d \u201cIn the 1960 letter Buffett writes: \u201cI have pointed out that any superior record which we might accomplish should not be expected to be evidenced by a relatively constant advantage in performance compared to the Average. Rather it is likely that if such an advantage is achieved, it will be through better-than-average performance in stable or declining markets and average, or perhaps even poorer-than-average performance in rising markets.\u201d\u201d (Annex Fig. 1,2) Fig 2,3. Warren Buffett compounded at 22% from 1968 to 2012, underperformed the S&P 500 one out of every three years during that run. Source Summit Street Capital Management \u201cI have pointed out that any superior record which we might accomplish should not be expected to be evidenced by a relatively constant advantage in performance compared to the Average. Rather it is likely that if such an advantage is achieved, it will be through better-than-average performance in stable or declining markets and average, or perhaps poorer-than-average performance in rising markets\u201d \u201cGood investment process is not apparent in one quarter\u2019s worth of transient stock price quotations, or one year for that matter!\u201d \u201cThe prime determinants of outcome are price (sticking to 50 cents on the dollar) and capital allocation by management. The first is in our control, that is, it is in our control to be patient and wait for the right price. The second involves a subjective judgment about the quality of management, and an assessment about the sustainability of business returns in the long run. It is these factors that occupy almost all our time. \u201c \u201cOur aim is to make investments at prices we consider to be fifty cents on the dollar of what a typical firm is worth. Capital allocation by investee companies must be consistent with value creation and, if this is the case, we expect that the real value of the business (the 100 cents value) could grow at around 10% per annum. The effect over five years will be to compound U$1 of value into U$1.62, and companies that can build value like this are normally rewarded in the market with a fair valuation (i.e., are priced close to U$1.62). This happy outcome would imply a return from purchase price (50 cents) of around 26% per annum. So, what happens when we are wrong? Our most common mistake is to misjudge capital allocation decisions by our companies: firms which articulate a share repurchase/debt repayment strategy and have incentives to reinforce that outcome, throw caution to the wind and make acquisitions instead. The Partnership\u2019s investment in Readers Digest falls into this category. Capital allocation mistakes such as these often prevent the compounding of value but to date have rarely resulted in a permanent decline in the share price to below our purchase price (50 cents). We have therefore tended to find that our mistakes atrophy (stay cheap) rather than collapse, although we can all name one collapse!\u201d \u201cThe debate over growth and value is perennial, and quite unnecessary. Warren Buffett got it right years ago: \u201cWhether appropriate or not, the term \u201cvalue investing\u201d is widely used. Typically, it connotes the purchase of stocks having attributes such as a low ratio of price to book value, a low price-earnings ratio, or a high dividend yield. Unfortunately, such characteristics, even if they appear in combination, are far from determinative as to whether an investor is indeed buying something for what it is worth and is therefore truly operating on the principle of obtaining value in his investments. Correspondingly, opposite characteristics \u2013 a high ratio of price to book value, a high price-earnings ratio, a low dividend yield \u2013 are in no way inconsistent with a \u201cvalue\u201d purchase.\u201d Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1992 Annual Report We won\u2019t end the debate here but, so that we all understand, Growth is therefore inherently part of the value judgment, not a separate discipline. \u2026 and why do commentators continue to use price to book ratios, price to earnings ratios or their modern equivalents such as EV to Ebitda, as a proxy for value. We all know that it does not mean a thing. So why do we do it? \u2026 However, in the stock market, doing half the work (only observing a portion of the wardrobe) is of limited benefit if successful investment requires more work. Price to book, price to cash flow etc., cannot be an accurate substitute for the definition we provided above. Their informational value, leaving aside inaccuracy for a moment, can be limited if only because successful investing is a minority sport. Their survival can probably be attributed to intellectual laziness on the part of the investment professional, and spin on the part of the industry\u2019s marketing departments. It certainly has little to do with investment excellence.\u201d \u201cIt is worth noting also that the Partnership results have been achieved without leverage, shorting or financial derivatives of any kind, nor do we wish to employ such techniques. Rather our results have been achieved the old-fashioned way, through buying securities in reasonable businesses at discounted prices.\u201d \u201cIf the share price is being set by those with an eye on the next data point, then they can\u2019t also be looking out for long-term value. There are few traders that disagree with Bezos\u2019 value creation process, but they don\u2019t think it will show up in the numbers just yet. And if you only own shares for a month or two then you may get away with several trades before Amazon\u2019s success becomes apparent. Good luck to them. Picking up pennies in front of a juggernaut is just not how we behave. \u201c Portfolio Management \u201cIt may also be worth reiterating that the results have been achieved without leverage, shorting, contracts for difference, options, synthetic structures (LYONs, PRIDEs, LEAPs, MASTs \u2013 we are not making these names up) or financial exotica of any sort. \u2026 and the results below have been achieved without the investment Viagras that have become so popular with the get-rich-quick-crowd. The results have been earned the old-fashioned way, through contrarian stock picking.\u201d \u201c We have ended up with a portfolio of owner-managed businesses as a byproduct of our assessment of the quality of the people involved. In other words, these managers earned their way into the portfolio. We feel slightly foolish for not recognizing this trait in advance, but, of course, we would have a bias toward founder-managed businesses (duh!). \u201c \u201cThe problem of course is price. In paying up for excellent businesses today, investors are already paying for many years growth to come, in the hope that, as the saying goes, \u201ctime is the friend of a good business\u201d. Those that chase high prices today, leave less gunpowder for the future.\u201d \u201cEven though prices are generally high, the trick is to do the work today, so that we are ready.\u201d \u201cOur portfolio inaction continues and we are delighted to report that purchase and sale transactions have all but ground to a halt. Our expectation is that this is a considerable source of value added! \u2026 but we do know that the average time S&P500 constituent stocks have been included in that index is twenty-five years. \u2026 As Berkshire Hathaway Vice-Chairman, Charlie Munger, says, you make your real money sitting on your assets!\u201d \u201cCostco\u2019s obsession with sharing scale benefits with the customer makes that company\u2019s future much more predictable and less risky than the average business and that is why it is our largest holding. Our smaller holdings are less predictable but in certain circumstances could do much better as investments. We are just not sure that they will as their \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d has a much greater radius than at Costco. \u201c \u201cSo, what you are trying to do as an investor is exploit the fact that fewer things will happen than can happen.\u201d \u201cZak and I expect that we have built a portfolio not just for the recovery out of recession but for many years after that too. At least, we aim for such a Zen-like state.\u201d \u201cIn reality opportunities in which we are comfortable to deploy capital are rare, and the highest conviction ideas the rarest of them all. The issue then is how much to invest in each idea? Bill Miller, who has run the Legg Mason Value Trust so brilliantly for many years, suggests the use of a system devised in 1956 by J. L. Kelly. A simplified version of the Kelly criterion is that investors should bet a proportion of the portfolio equal to 2.1 x p \u2013 1.1, where p is the probability of being right. The common-sense outcome of this equation is that if one is certain of being right, one should invest the entire portfolio in that idea. Even if one is say, 75% certain of being right the correct weighting remains high at 47.5% ((2.1 x 0.75) \u2013 1.1). But does anyone do that? But is this not the right way to think? If you know you are right, why would you not bet a high proportion of the portfolio in that idea? The logical extension of this line of thought is that Nomad\u2019s portfolio concentration has at times been too low. And if it has been too low at Nomad, what has been going on at the large mutual fund complexes with many hundred stocks in a single country portfolio? Apply the Kelly criterion, and the average fund manager would appear to have almost no clue as to the likely success of any one idea. If you do not share this view, think long and hard about your investment in Nomad.\u201d \u201c\u2026the best defense is to own enough of the company to influence the outcome. In most cases in excess of 10% of the shares outstanding would suffice. Those that advocate market liquidity of their investments over other considerations might like to bear in mind an investor\u2019s inability to influence outcomes whilst owning a de minimus proportion of a company. Should Nomad continue to grow in size, we intend not to make this mistake\u201d. \u201cThe church of diversification, in whose pews the professional fund management industry sits, proposes many holdings. They do this not because managers have so many insights, but so few! Diversity, in this context, is seen as insurance against any one idea being wrong. Like Darwin, we find ourselves disagreeing with the theocracy. We would propose that if knowledge is a source of value added, and few things can be known for sure, then it logically follows that owning more stocks does not lower risk but raises it! Real diversification is offered by index funds at a fraction of the price of active management. Sam Walton did not make his money through diversifying his holdings. Nor did Gates, Carnegie, McMurtry, Rockefeller, Slim, Li Ka-shing or Buffett. Great businesses are not built that way. Indeed, the portfolios of these men were, more or less, one hundred percent in one company and they did not consider it risky\u201d Global diversification \u201cThe geographical distribution is as follows: south east Asia 32.8%; North America 23.6%; Europe 12.7% and other emerging markets 2.9%.\u201d \u201cGeographically the distribution is as follows: US 41%, Hong Kong 14%, UK 12%, Thailand 9%, South Africa 6%, Malaysia 5%, and Norway and Singapore 4% each.\u201d \u201cInvestors are often guilty of chasing the new-new thing far from home sometimes in the name of diversification, or higher returns, or both. To our way of thinking such activity often has more to do with marketing than it does with underlying investment reality.\u201d Cash \u201cAnd for most of the decade, there has been nothing as sinful in an investor\u2019s mind as money idly slouching on deposit, \u201con the couch\u201d as the investor Seth Klarman put it. Instead, cash must be put to work: its yield maximised. \u2026 Output maximisation looks efficient at least in the short term, but that is not the same as being long term optimal. The flaw to putting money to work immediately, for instance, is to presume that all relevant opportunity sets are available immediately. By accepting, say, a promoter\u2019s promise of eight percent returns (six hundred basis points better than money on deposit), the investor denies himself the right to future opportunity sets which may be far better, like public equity circa 2008 and 2009, we would argue. \u2026 It is, however, an argument for a cash buffer, just in case, a little slack in the system.\u201d Business Valuation \u201creturn on capital at Nomad\u2019s firms is over twice that of competing businesses.\u201d \u201cwe try to take Charles Darwin\u2019s approach: deemphasise the data collection and think. When we study truly great businesses, we find that very often it has been simple human attributes that have led to their success: you feel differently drinking a Coke than a no brand cola or, you may feel differently towards a business that consistently undercuts the competition in price or, a delivery service that literally goes the extra mile and picks up returned items \u2013 and the reason you have these feelings, and the stimuli that produce them, have hardly changed in millennia.\u201d \u201cWhat characteristics could one bestow on a company that would make it the most valuable in the world? What would it look like? Such a firm would have a huge marketplace (offering size), high barriers to entry (offering longevity) and very low levels of capital employed (offering free cash flow).\u201d \u201cA business ought to be able to self-fund its own growth, and if the opportunity set is large, then the return on capital needs to be suitably high. Second, barriers to entry should increase with size; that way a company\u2019s moat is widened as the firm grows. To do this, the basic building block of the business, its skeletal structure, is probably best kept very simple. In short, we want a skeletal structure that can support growth from mouse to elephant without too much skeletal reengineering.\u201d \u201cWhen we evaluate potential investments, we are looking for businesses trading at around half of their real business value, companies run by owner-oriented management and employing capital allocation strategies consistent with long term shareholder wealth creation.\u201d \u201cThe answer lies in analyzing not the effects and outputs of a business, but, digging down to the underlying reality of the company, the engine of its success. That is, one must see an investment not as a static balance sheet but as an evolving, compounding machine. \u201c \u201cWhen looking for an explanation to a situation the brain tends to latch on to what can be easily found to \u201cframe\u201d the situation, and if what is easily found is also vivid, then the brain stops looking for another explanation. I had gone looking for what I thought ought to be there, a vivid smoking gun such as a brand name, a location, a clever re- insurance contract, or a patent. However, there is no a priori reason why a comparative advantage should be one big thing, any more than many smaller things. Indeed, an interlocking, self-reinforcing network of small actions may be more successful than one big thing. \u2026 firms that have a process to do many things a little better than their rivals may be less risky than firms that do one thing right because their future success is more predictable. They are simply harder to beat. And if they are harder to beat then they may be very valuable businesses indeed\u201d \u201cit was the success and economics of line extensions (incremental products) and advertising that, in our opinion, was what the long-term investor really needed to embrace. \u2026 Recognising and correctly weighing this information in spite of the latest news flow is a matter of discipline, and it is that discipline that is so richly rewarded in the end. The simple deep reality for many of our firms is the virtuous spiral established when companies keep costs down, margins low and in doing so share their growing scale with their customers. \u2026 \u201cThere are two ways to build a successful company. One is to work very, very hard to convince customers to pay high margins [the Colgate, Nike, Coca-Cola model alluded to above]. The other is to work very, very hard to be able to offer customers low margins [the Wal-Mart, Costco, AirAsia, Amazon, Asos model]. They both work. We\u2019re firmly in the second camp. It\u2019s difficult \u2013 you have to eliminate defects and be very efficient. But it\u2019s also a point of view. We\u2019d rather have a very large customer base and low margins than a small customer base and higher margins.\u201d \u201c Jeff Bezos\u201d \u201cSo, having shared low costs with their customers, how are our firms\u2019 relationships with their customers going? One way to look at this is revenue growth.\u201c \u201cSouter began cutting away the weak businesses, a process Charlie Munger, vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway refers to as the \u201ccancer surgery approach\u201d. This often works because there is normally a jewel at the heart of most companies that has often been used to fund new ventures or is taken for granted by impatient management. As the jewel becomes diluted by less successful projects aggregate performance declines and valuations atrophy or even fall. The star in this regard and in which Mr. Munger invested, is Coca-Cola, which in the mid 1980s had become a poorly defined conglomerate including a shrimp farm, winery, film studio and shudder to think, even owned its own bottling plants! As the poorer businesses were cut away, to reveal the jewel that is the syrup manufacturing and marketing operation, the shares of Coca-Cola rose over ten-fold in the succeeding decade. At Stagecoach the fix is relatively simple: cease investment in poor US operations,\u201d \u201cFor these investments to work over the long haul, what is required is a rational, honest mea-culpa and a low share price. The unforgiving nature of the markets often provides the latter. The former is much harder to come by.\u201d \u201cIf the market was rational and the company an organisation that learns, then the stock price should rise after a mistake.\u201d \u201cDepersonalisation inevitably leads to customer disloyalty and commoditisation, and that is not good for long term profitability, regardless of what the profits account reads today.\u201d Management Valuation \u201cOur first shareholder letter, in 1997, was entitled, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the long-term\u201d. If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you\u2019re competing against a lot of people. But if you are willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you\u2019re now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that. Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavours that you could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven years. We\u2019re willing to plant seeds, let them grow \u2013 and we\u2019re very stubborn. We say we are stubborn on the vision and flexible on the details\u201d. Jeff Bezos \u201cAlmost ninety percent of the portfolio is invested in firms run by founders or the largest shareholder\u201d \u201cFifty-five percent of portfolio companies are either repurchasing shares or have had meaningful insider buying.\u201d \u201cThere are only two reasons companies behave well. Because they want to, and because they have to. Our preference is to invest in those that want to.\u201d \u201cMath-based decisions command wide agreement, whereas judgment-based decisions are rightly debated and often controversial, at least until put into practice and demonstrated. Any institution unwilling to endure controversy must limit itself to decisions of the first type. In our view, doing so would not only limit controversy \u2013 it would also significantly limit innovation and long-term value creation\u201d. Jeff Bezos \u201cEarly in a firm\u2019s development it makes sense to reward customers disproportionately as customer referrals and repeat business are so essential to the development of a valuable franchise. With maturity this bias can be reduced, and shareholders can reasonably take a greater slice of the pie. Too much, however, and the moat is drained with negative consequences for longevity. The temptations are enormous because capital markets will reward profiteering.\u201d \u201cWhat passes for industry standard best practice today may look short term efficient but, in any lasting sense of the word, and from the perspective of the long-term business owner, it does not really get the job done.\u201d \u201cIf the existing portfolio is to be successful then our results will come from the mismatch between the orientation of the founders and the mark to market mentality of the quarterly holding period investors that set the price of the companies on the stock market. \u201c \u201cAll the social pressure will be to conform with industry norm but these companies have a deep keel that keeps them upright. \u201c \u201c\u201cif you want to be successful, and we do, then you have to be willing to be misunderstood, and do things that do not seem sensible to most people. We start with the customer and work backwards\u201d Founder of one of Nomad\u2019s investee firms \u2026 In other words, his company had an internal compass with true north pointing to what was right for the customer. \u2026 Zak and I would guestimate that fewer than five percent of publicly listed firms do what they think is right, rather than what they think plays well with the outside world (media, Wall Street, investors). Even so, the vast majority of Nomad\u2019s firms do what is right long term.\u201d \u201cThe same is probably true for Jim Sinegal before his retirement (Costco), Lord Harris (Carpetright) and some of the other founders of the firms in which Nomad has invested. These people derive meaning from the challenge, identity, creativity, ethos (this list is not exhaustive) of their work, and not from the incentive packages their compensation committees have devised for them. \u2026 It was an arbitrary number in the first place, and we derive a great deal of value from the meaning of the work we do (challenge, sense of job well done, identity, creativity and so on) not just from the financial rewards (although we will learn to live with those too!). By having an attitude that is somewhat independent of financial rewards, we are sure that Nomad\u2019s performance in the long run will be far better too.\u201d \u201cZak\u2019s family\u2019s activity centre beat the competition because they understood the difference between good costs (nice staff, clean loos, good coffee) and bad costs (a whizzo new slide) and invested appropriately. They were smart enough to poll customers and observe the influence of pricing (there was no need to over-discount). The operation was equity funded and did not include a third party in the capital structure (bank debt). But most of all it was founder managed and they cared. Watching the pennies and investing carefully has led to the \u201caggregation of marginal gains\u201d and financial success, and as such it has much in common with the investments that populate Nomad. It has been fun for Zak and me to practice in the real world, what we preach in investing.\u201d \u201cIn the office we keep a list of companies assembled under the title \u201csuper high-quality thinkers\u201d. This is not an easy club to join, and the list currently runs to fifteen businesses. Entry is reserved for the intellectually honest and economically rational, but that alone is not enough. There are many companies that do the right thing when their backs are against the wall, and this list excludes those temporarily attending church. The anointed few are there because they have chosen to out-think their competition and allocate capital over many years with discipline to reinforce their firm\u2019s competitive advantage. Good capital allocation takes many forms and does not necessarily require a firm to grow. \u2026 After all, why grow if returns are going to be poor? However, surprisingly few companies have the strength to just sit it out, or shrink, as The clamor comes from within the company (reinforced by poorly constructed incentive compensation), Wall Street promoters and short-term shareholders.\u201d The Helper\u2019s journey: CASES STUDY Amazon \u201cOur businesses are surging ahead, even if, in some cases, their share prices are half what they were twelve months ago. In the last few months Amazon has been priced in the market as if it would not grow in the future, despite some of the best growth prospects we can imagine.\u201d \u201cHowever, our quantitative understanding of elasticity is short-term. We can estimate what a price reduction will do this week and this quarter. But we cannot numerically estimate the effect that consistently lowering prices will have on our business over five years or ten years. Our judgment is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long-term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.com.\u201d Jeff Bezos \u201cAmazon.com may be following this path as well. So, the first point is that whilst Costco continues to recycle cost savings to the consumer, it is lowering the probability of failure. So, what heuristics do investors incorrectly apply to Costco (why might the shares be mispriced?). Heuristic One: \u201cthe company has low margins\u201d (net profit margin is 1.7%, compared to Wal Mart at 3.6% and Target at 4.2%). True, but that\u2019s the point. The firm is deferring profits today in order to extend the life of the franchise. Heuristic Two: \u201cit\u2019s expensive at 24x earnings\u201d. Really? Net income is a small residual, as discussed above. Heuristic Three: \u201cCostco has a cost problem\u201d. Costs have risen as a percentage of revenues in the last few years due to the expense of a warehouse and distribution system associated with the next phase of the firm\u2019s growth and the cost of employee benefits and insurance, especially in California.\u201d \u201cBezos was also quite forthright on the subject of product promotion and advertising at this year\u2019s annual general meeting: \u201cAdvertising is the price you pay for having an unremarkable product or service\u201d. \u201cAmazon.com. Last year the company reported free cash flow of just over U$500m, indeed it has been around this number for the last few years. What is important is that the U$500m is after all investment spending on growth initiatives such as capital spending, but also research and development, shipping subsidy, marketing and advertising and price givebacks. \u201c \u201cAmazon, for example, is choosing \u201cnot to participate\u201d in as much as trailing twelve- month revenues have risen by over sixty percent since the onset of the credit crisis, say mid 2007. Not that the steady growth in revenues has always been apparent in its stock price, as the chart below describes. As a youthful analyst I used to have a notice on my desk that read, \u201cshare prices are more volatile than corporate cash flow, which is more volatile than asset replacement cost\u201d. It was reminder to concentrate on non-transitory items. Today I would update such a notice to read, \u201cshare prices are more volatile than business values\u201d, but the gist is the same: a reminder to focus on lasting value, not transitory prices. \u201c \u201cOur hunch is that the growth rate in online retailing is regulated, not by physical capacity, although that can be a limiting factor, but more by the rate at which our own incumbent habits and associations are replaced with more rational behaviour. \u2026 if the rate of growth in internet retailing is a product of attitude, rather than assets, then, the fact that a firm is quite large already does not necessarily tell you that its growth rate is set to slow\u201d Costco \u201cAt Costco, the consumer has chosen to commit to the retailer. In other words, people shop at Costco because it is Costco, not because Costco stocks Coke. And the reason they shop is that goods are priced at a fixed maximum 14% mark up over cost. Costco must ensure that: (1) Operating costs are low, indeed very low. It is indicative of the paranoia with which the company is run that costs are measured in basis points (there are 100 basis points in one percentage point) (2) That the wholesale price is as competitive as can be. \u201cWe expect all vendors to consistently and voluntarily quote the lowest possible acquisition price available on all items. A vendor who does not consistently and voluntarily quote its lowest prices to our buyers will be permanently discontinued as a purchasing source for Costco.\u201d Source: Costco.co.uk (3) Revenues need to be very high Costco is the best example we can find of one of them: scale efficiencies shared. Most companies pursue scale efficiencies, but few share them. It\u2019s the sharing that makes the model so powerful.\u201d Indications are that the company is gently tinkering with the division of benefits in favour of shareholders in part to satisfy the quarterly EPS junkies but also in recognition that an asset-rich Costco represents an attractive target for private equity buyers. Long-term shareholders should view such slippage as worrying and unnecessary. In our view, the correct response to a six-year share price famine is for the company to use its balance sheet to buy back shares at prevailing prices and allow the long-term growth in free cash flow per share (an inescapable function of steady margins, falling asset intensity, growing revenues and a shrinking base of shares outstanding) to translate into a higher share price over time. Dell \u201cMichael Dell succeeded by keeping costs low and passing back his scale benefits to the buyer of his PCs\u201d \u201cA study by Michael Goldstein at Empirical Research, a research boutique, claims that 49 the probability of growth stock failure (company growth slowing) is as high as four in five over five years and nine out of ten over ten years. And in the case of Dell, we would have been wrong.\u201d Walmart \u201cAlthough we are all interested in margin, it must never be done at the expense of our philosophy. Margin must be obtained by better buying, emphasis on selling the kind of goods we want to sell, operating efficiencies, lower markdowns, greater turnover, etc. Increasing the retail prices and justifying it on the basis that we are still \u201ccompetitive\u201d could lead to a rude awakening as it has with so many. Let us concentrate on how cheap we can bring things to the people, rather than how much the traffic will bear, and when the race is over Fed-Mart will be there\u201d. [The best summary of the business case for scale economics shared we have come across]. Sol Price, Fed-Mart\u2019s founder \u201cin the 1950s a large Baltimore based fund management company sold their clients\u2019 shares in IBM only for the shares to appreciate to the point that the value of the shares sold would become bigger than the whole fund management company itself. What we are trying to do today is avoid the Baltimore company\u2019s second mistake, which was to sell an equally big stake in Wal-Mart in the 1970s!\u201d (Fig.4) Fig 4. Wal-mart \u201cIn our opinion, the central engine of success at WalMart was a thrift orientation fueling growth with the savings shared with the customer. \u2026 Instead, investors may place too much emphasis on valuation heuristics, or margin trends, or incremental growth rates in revenues or any of the list above, but these items are transitory and anecdotal in nature \u2026 Put simply: average companies do not do scale economics shared. Average companies do not have a healthy culture. \u2026 It is a huge anomaly that investors recognize success incrementally when the factors that lead to success, such as scale economics shared reinforced by a strong culture, may be constant. \u201c AirAsia \u201cTake Air Asia: The firm was born with a no frills, cost culture with the result that, we estimate, it is the lowest cost airline in the world: this is favourable branch one. Favourable branch two: the employees take pride in the firm, suggest their own savings and the savings are implemented. Branch three: the savings exceed the peer group and are given back to customers in the form of lower prices. Branch four: the customer reciprocates and revenues rise. Branch five: further scale advantages lead to more savings per seat flown. Branch six: further customer reciprocation. Branch seven: the network builds and crowds out other, less efficient airlines. Branch eight: competitors go out of business?\u201d \u201cSo, in our opinion, it won\u2019t be the on-line fraud, per se, or, heaven forbid, an airplane crash at AirAsia, that could ruin our firms, but a disingenuous response to a problem.\u201d Feel free to comment, share my article with friends and subscribe to my newsletter if you like my content and you want to follow me towards financial freedom.

Fig. TEDx Talk: The future of an immersive Metaverse | Artur Sychov | TEDxUNYP Metaverse in the context of physical and digital scarcity. Automatization, by its nature, is a deflationary force, the unique force with delocalization of labor able of guaranteeing a profit margin sufficient to maintain profitable a businessin an environment with inflationary force in the game (monetary and fiscal policy). Mind share and brand awareness also preserve profitability but it goes beyond the scope of this article. Inflation accentuates the competition, namely the rationalization in the uses of scarce resources (commodities). Thus the unavoidable consequence, for an over indebted western world, it\u2019s to convert the labor force in an automated process (Software is eating the world \u2013 Marc Andreessen), namely the perfect optimization of the resources with a reduced environmental impact. I see a natural trend that is resource rationalization. We follow that line since the beginning of the species, there is some volatility, but the millennial trend is here to stay. We are more and more on this planet, we must become more and more able to optimize our space, even building new dimensions (metaverse) or discovering new ones (space). The last injection of liquidity by central banks accelerated this trend. Side note: nat gas, water, healthcare, education, commodities and product/services are not localizable and difficult to automate. By the way there exists a solution for that, offered once again by technology, called the metaverse, to begin with digital socialization (social network), job digital environment (WFH), through digital education. It works if we implement global and portable digital certifications, as for example a Proof of Attendance (POAP)., These are all activities requiring less commodities and less energy (think about taking the car to go to work and the energy used to run he building where you work, or the physical mall where you do physical shopping, moreover think about the physical space occupied by this buildings, it\u2019s a waste of scarce resources and space. Even more obvius the digitalization of paper as a mean to transfer and storing informations, the results is the preservation of forests, another scarce resource). Entertainment has already undergone this process (i.e., Netflix), indeed it does not suffer from inflation. Once I created an intellectual property, I share it to the world by exploiting scale, scale defined by my network effect, here the value of the investment. I personally participated in a series of lectures by Balaji Srinivasan in a digital environment with other people around the world, and it was a mind blowing experience. #NFTCommunityInteresting use of NFT as a proof of attendance. In the future certificates will be on-chain and classrooms will be VR environments where the best teachers of the world give lessons.1729 Beta Lecture 7 Attendee POAP NFT! https://t.co/LzdTwKzvaB via @poapxyz\u2014 davesoma.eth (@Dave45291968) January 1, 2022 Here my \u201cProof of Attendance\u201d, an unique digital certificate NFT freerly mint to certificates my attendance to the lecture: People need to signal their social status through scarce items, support this behavior in a digital environment it\u2019s necessary. The more extended the network, the more the item will have value. In a world where commodities are scarce and the environmental impact unsustainable, translating our social/hierarchical behavior in a digital dimension could be a good solution to maintain incentives and in the meantime protecting our physical dimension (planet). The transaction to the metaverse has already started, metaverse being a series of intermediary destinations. At the moment, I see an investing opportunity in owning these infrastructures, an intermediate crisis is highly probable, but past this moment our species could be free, freeing our time, and thanks to digital infrastructure, reducing the friction in our communication physical and emotional. That means more time for creative tasks, aka evolution, infinite attempts on infinite brains interconnected with infinite time without capital limitation, hyperbolic metaphor, etc.. Think about the number of geniuses in the underdeveloped country who can self-learn thanks to the internet. An example of decentralized real estate in the metaverse is my blog, it has a lot of visuals from India. As usual, you gain freedom with intellectual work. In a context like this, centralization is a threat. Centralizing the metaverse, meant as a digital shared environment where every kind of data freely flows into a centralized entity (including data on our emotions states), would become a real threat for the survival of the species. This means giving total power to an entity to manipulate and control our digital global platform, potentially this entity could give us tons of illusions, and lose our life forever in an infinite loop of illusions perfectly tailored on the basis of the data gathered in real time on our life and our emotions . In some ways it is already like it, consumers of illusions fed by the marketers, from the birth of Santa Claus. With the centralization of data, this threat could become exponential at the point to lose the reality, giving total power to the entity which feeds us realistic and abundant illusions. \u201cMorpheus: Everything begins with choice. Merovingian: No. \u2026 Choice is an illusion, created between those with power, and those without.\u201d Matrix, directed by Lana Wachowski, Lilly Wachowski \u201cThis Metaverse is going to be far more pervasive and powerful than anything else. If one central company gains control of this, they will become more powerful than any government and be a god on Earth.\u201d\u2013 Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games Gamers as precursors of the digital shared worlds are aware of this. In my personal opinion decentralization of personal data and rendering the individual sovereign of himself is the only feasible way to follow, even if in some sense it goes against human nature, as explained by the founder of Signal in this article. By following our millennial trend, I see an inflection point in the creation by Satoshi of a decentralized and antifragile platform as Bitcoin throught a consensus algorithm, the embryonic version of the backbone of our future digital reality, which preserves our identity and its portability and thus our freedom, this will challenge even the notion of state. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley\u2019s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.\u2026Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, Neil Postman Decentralization is the only way to pursue the truth and creativity is the ultimate scarce resource and engine of our evolution as a species. There is no innovation without creativity and there is no creativity without truth. \u201cThe meaning of life is something we are using creativity to discover, to build. We can\u2019t find the meaning of life in the world \u2018out there\u2019, nor just by pure thought, or by reference to an authority.\u201d David Deutsch Moreover there is no shared reality without digital scarcity/uniqueness and the value will be conferred by the extension of the network.

In my opinion, the Cash Flow statement is the most important because it describes the amount of cash and cash equivalents entering the company. What we are going to learn: What is the cash flow? Why is it a better representation of the company\u2019s ability to generate cash? Why does a Cash Flow Statement help to avoid financial fraud? Its role in calculating the intrinsic value of a company CF Equity/levered and CF Firm/unlevered Some useful metrics Cash flow in the context of the maturation stage As we saw in the first article, the income statement uses the accrual basis accounting, in other words, it tries to match revenues and expenses at the time when the transaction occurs. The cash flow statement recognizes the transaction when the money is transferred. This absence of further manipulation, sometimes, defines a more honest picture of the business, for that reason I particularly like this statement, and it\u2019s a good idea to always reason in terms of Cash in and Cash out. Email Address I used the engine allegory to define the income statement, but the real fuel of our company is represented in the Cash flow statement. The energy generation of an engine depends on the efficiency of the system, indeed electric motors are more energy saving, than internal combustion engines (ICE). The latter are also known as heath engines. In thermodynamics, a heat engine is a system that converts heat to mechanical energy, as is the case for the ICE because this engine work by burning fuels to release heat through chemical reactions and eventually producing mechanical thrust. But,what does financial statements have to do with thermodynamics? Because we are going to search for the engine with less energetic dispersion, in other words, the more efficient company. Our money is the fuel and we want the best energetic returns for the fuel we inject. In the Cash Flow statement we can check that efficiency. What are some examples of \u201cenergy dispersion\u201d? Wrong investments. Spendthrift manager (i.e, who pays for expensive headquarter, private jet, \u2026). Absence of competitive advantage, which leads to tons of money burned in marketing expenses or trying to keep up with technology innovation without gaining extra cash. Excessive headcount. \u201cDiworsification\u201d and serial acquisitions in an attempt to expand the business and improve the cash flow, but with the result of lack of synergy and less efficiency. (Watch out from CEO with expansion feticism, they want to expand their power on new lands but with detriment results for shareholders, maybe because his compensation is based on the rate of growth). \u201cMore value is destroyed by acquisitions than any other single action taken by companies\u201d Aswath Damodaran, NY University Cash Flow Fig 2 . Cash Flow Statement scheme Damodaran \u201cLook, son, at the end of the day it is all about cash-in, and cash- out\u201d. Nomad Letter 2011 The logic behind the Cash Flow statement is simple, we have: Cash Inflow: Revenue from goods and services, loan receipts, cash dividends, interest earned, asset sales, grants, any form of cash received. Cash Outflow: Payroll, capital expenditures, supplier payments, taxes, commissions, interest paid, costs tied to the operations, rent, debt payments, equity investment, repurchase of common stocks, dividends. Ideally, our goal as investors is extracting cash overtime from our business, as a landowner wants to extract rents from his tenants through the collection of rents. As I said, engine fuel gives us kinetic energy through chemical and physical processes. Thanks to the income statement and the cash flow statement, we can check how much energy goes wasted in the process of generating our wealth. We are going to scan our engine with a thermal visor detecting money dispersion and managerial inefficiency. You can think of companies as a wealth engine, differently from an ICE engine, our engine will compound over time making us rich, in article 7. How companies reward us we already covered this point. The ultimate goal of the free market is efficient capital allocation (long-term efficiency!). Your goal is to rationalize your cognitive process in order to discover efficient allocation, the engine with less energy dispersion, and a modern and efficient electric engine. You are part of the free market engine of this world! You are voting with your feet, in this case with your money! Another thing to consider, is that cash flows are said to be harder to manipulate than earnings, so many investors tell you to just ignore earnings and look at the cash flow statement instead. I usually look first at the income statement, and if it is interesting I dig deeper and take a look at the Cash Flow Statement. Qualitative earnings convert a great portion into cash flows, frauds usually report strong earnings numbers, but generate little cash, it is a red flag. This happens because the accrual method lends itself to be easily manipulated, unlike the cash accounting (which hidden some traps too). Fig 3. Spredgar comparison of EPS and the free cash flow of Enron Enron was an American energy, commodities and service company. Enron filed for bankruptcy in late 2001 after a series of financial frauds. Here some good examples where you can spot anomalies thanks to the Cash Flow Statements. Washington Post 2002 Enron article Cash Flow isn\u2019t the whole story but could be a good starting point to spot accounting shenanigans. Fig 4. Enron stock price For a deeper analysis on frauds and financial tricks I recommend the following book: Financial Shenanigans: How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks & Fraud in Financial ReportsHoward Mark Schilit Other excellent reads can be viewed in my Books article. Operating Cash Flow Fig 5. OCF scheme Damodaran As you can see from the Damodaran scheme, we use the indirect method to reach our Operating Cash Flow figure. In other words, we start from Net income and we add back non-cash expenses. Operational Cash Flow represents the cash generated by the company business operation, in this sense in my opinion is the most important part of the statement. The Cash Flow Statement has another advantage respect to the income statement, since it is an honest representation of the cash generated by the company in a given period it leave out non-cash expenses (e.g D&A Depreciation and Amortization, SBC Stock based compensation) and some gain unrelated to the operation of the business, as is the case for the gain of the marketable securities investments. It is worth highlighting that D&A and SBC are real costs, then it\u2019s important to add capital expenditure back as we will see in the section related to Free Cash Flow. Unfortunately a recent policy change adds the capital gain of securities, like for example stocks, in the income of the company. \u201cBenefit users by providing a more relevant measurement attribute for equity investments through the requirement of equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\u201d FASB.org ASU 2016-1 Given its huge collection of equity securities Berkshire Hathaway could be a good example, since the introduction of the new policy its net income has become more unstable. Fig 6. Berkshire Hathaway earnings instability since introduction of ASU 2016-1 \u201cThe new rule says that the net change in unrealized investment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be included in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capricious swings in our GAAP bottom-line. For analytical purposes, Berkshire\u2019s \u2018bottom line\u2019 will be useless.\u201d Warren Buffett, 2017 letter to shareholders As we said Mr Market (article 8. Mr Market) is a fickle guy: the appreciation of the market value in the short term does not tell us anything regarding the company we are analyzing. In this case we can rely on the operating cash flow in order to obtain a better picture Fig 7. Berkshire Hathaway 2020 Cash Flow Statements, addition unrealized securities gains These examples show how the net income is manipulable and sometimes deceptive without the correct perspective, yet a cash flow statement is a better tool to correctly interpret the business. Net income larger than the Operating Cash Flow is a warning sign, indeed it is defined as a red flag in the Piotroski F-Score (used to quantitatively define the quality of earnings and strength of a company\u2019s financial position investopedia.com). Operating Cash Flow will be the main figure when finally we will calculate the intrinsic value of our company! \u201cExpected long-term cash flows, discounted by the cost of capital\u2014not reported earnings\u2014determine stock prices.\u201d Michael J. Mauboussin, Morgan Stanley Cash is always the King! GAAP and non \u2013 GAAP Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) The GAAP is a set of accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The GAAP\u2019s aim is standardized financial statements and allow the comparability of the financial information. Public companies in the US must follow GAAP to compile their financial statements. For example the Operating Cash Flow described above is a GAAP figure. Most of the companies in the US represent their accounting figures under the GAAP accounting principle. Non-GAAP Sometimes companies manufacture nonstandard metrics. Some metrics could be useful, some others could be misleading. It\u2019s always good to stick with GAAP numbers and always be wary of non-GAAP numbers. The most commonly used non-GAAP figure shown by management is the Free Cash Flow. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) IFRS is the counterpart of GAAP, but adopted outside the US, as GAAP, IFRS are a set of accounting rules for financial statements of the public. The rules of IFRS are beyond the scope of this article, to dig into the topic I suggest you read the investopedia write-up. Free Cash Flow An example of a non-GAAP financial measure is the Free Cash Flow. It is an important figure, because it tells us how much money is left to pay us. FCF = OCF +/- Change WC- CapEx Capital Expenditure (CapEx) can be found in the Cash Flow from investing activities section, and it represents the funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade and maintain physical assets. For example property, plants, buildings, equipment and the various technologies needed in order to make the business. Remember: not all the Capital Expenditures are created equal. The cash used to grow our business (Growth CapEx) will give us more earnings and ideally more reward in the long term (dividends, buybacks) while the cash used to maintain the business is often used to stay afloat and keep up with competitors (Maintenance CapEx). Money machine make \u2013 Money machine spends to keeps machine full efficiency = Owner\u2019s earnings Here an important concept about owner\u2019s earnings, initially proposed by Warren Buffett \u201cCalculate \u201cowner earnings\u201d to get a true reflection of value.\u201d Warren Buffett underlined the importance of making a distinction from the energy employed for growth, and energy \u201cwasted\u201d to simply stay afloat, as is the case for the heat generated by an ICE engine. A company which \u201cwaste\u201d too much money, usually, doesn\u2019t have a strong competitive advantage, this competitive advantage takes the form of a brand which maintains a market leadership without incessantly investing to keep up with new competitors which tries to conquer the market (15. Income Statement \u2013 Mindshare). As we saw, Capital expenditure could be divided into Maintenance and Growth. Rarely, companies show two different figures. Often we have to estimate it (my suggestion is to always be conservative). We have to deeply understand our business to draw a line between the two Capital Expenditures. What interests us, as investors, is the cash will arrive in our pockets in the future. That cash arrives in the form of dividend, buybacks or even investment for the future expansion. As explained in the last chapter (16. Balance Sheet Statement \u2013 ROIC), the Return on invested Capital (ROIC) represents the return on the capital the company invests in the business. If a company has a high ROIC (15%+) we can expect this as our future stock return, then if they can maintain this level, as intelligent investors, we prefer that the company spends the cash generated in order to fuel new projects which expand the business and the future Cash Flow. Indeed the math behind the company growth is: g = ROIC * RR g = growth ROIC = Return on invested Capital RR = Reinvestment Rate (which is the % of Net profit reinvested) Eventually, we want to obtain even more cash per unit (stock) by means of buybacks (shrinking the piece of the pie) or reinvestment in high ROI investments which increase the future cash flow (increase the cash per share, which eventually, in the late stage of the company, will lead to buybacks, which in turn lead to even more cash flow per share and ultimately lead to a huge cost basis dividend per share). The logical consequence is that, if a company can\u2019t find opportunities to reinvest the money at an high ROIC, repurchasing their own stocks could be a better idea in order to increase owner\u2019s value, if the stock is already overvalued the last thing to do is payout the Cash in the form of dividends. FCF Equity (Levered CF) and FCF Firm (Unlevered CF) There are two types of FCF: levered and unlevered. Levered reduces the FCF taking into account financial obligations (debts) Unlevered free cash flow is before mandatory debt payments are paid (lenders, investors, interest, etc.). Levered free cash flow is cash left after paying all the debt due during that period (scheduled interest, principal payments and fee), whereas Enterprise Value (already discussed in the article 16. Balance Sheet) is market cap adjusted for all debt and cash/cash equivalent. At the end of the day, FCFF (Firm) is the cash flow owned by stockholder and bondholders, thus tied to the value of the entire capital structure, Enterprise Value. FCFE (Equity) is the cash owned only by stockholders, for that reason we paired it with the Market Capitalization, namely the price paid by equity investors. Both should give you a similar valuation if you look at the averages. In a specific year they can be very different. FCFF (Unlevered) = OCF + Tax adjusted interest expense \u2013 CapEx FCFE (Levered) = NOPAT + D&A \u2013 CAPEX \u2013 change NWC NOPAT = Net Operating Profit After Tax Describe the potential cash distributed to shareholders and it doesn\u2019t take into account debt and debt interests. Another formula, which I personally use and will be use in the intrinsic value calculation: FCFE (Levered)= OCF \u2013 CapEx + Net Debt Issued (Repaid) Change in NWC is the increase/decrease the company incurred in the balance between current assets and liabilities, in other words the trajectory of the resources needed to operate the business in one year timeframe (notion already dives in the article. 17 Balance Sheet Analysis). NWC could hold or release cash, in other words if the management for example improved the inventory efficiency, could reduce the inventory and free up capital usable for rewarding shareholders or invest in new high ROIC projects. Change in Net Working Capital = Net Working Capital for Current Period \u2013 Net Working Capital for Previous Period Some companies have a negative working capital. For instance Redbubble Limited operates as an online marketplace that facilitates the sale of art and design products. An artist sends its design to RedBubble to put it, for example, on a t-shirt . RedBubble produces and sells this t-shirt on its marketplace, when the product is sold. RedBubble gives 15% of the profit to the artist, and retains the rest. Here RedBubble favorable working capital cycle. Fig 8. RedBubble (ASX:RBL) working capital cycle, source RedBubble investor presentation 2021 As you can see, RBL first collects the gross transaction value (GTV), and only after that it distributes the gains with the rest of the parts involved, artists receive their money only two weeks after. RedBubble generates cash extremely quickly, receiving funds from customers before it has to pay vendors. This is a favorable dynamic for RedBubble which implies a negative working capital cycle, typical of some business models. As usual there is always some warning signs to watch out for: \u201cWhile many investors are pleased when management says that it is \u201caggressively managing working capital,\u201d you should take this as a warning sign that recent CFFO growth may not be sustainable.\u201d Financial Shenanigans: How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks & Fraud in Financial Reports by Howard Schilit Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) To better understand the flow of cash in the Working Capital, it\u2019s a good idea to dig into the Cash Conversion Cycle. CCC is used by management to see how long the company\u2019s cash remains tied up to its operation. CCC = DIO + DSO \u2013 DPO Cash Inflow: DIO, Days Inventory Outstanding = the average number of days the company holds its inventory before selling it DSO, Days Sales Outstanding = the number of days of average sales the company has outstanding Cash Outflow (because of that ->minus sign in the formula): DPO, Days Payable Outstanding = The average number of days the company takes to pay its bills. A short CCC means better efficiency in the cash generation, freeing cash to make additional purchases or pay down outstanding debt. FCF per share \u2013 FCF/shares outstanding We had already discussed metrics which describe the profit per share, as is the case for Earning Per Share (EPS). I already extolled the Cash Flow Statement, then I cannot fail to mention the equivalent of EPS but using Cash Flow instead of Earnings. The advantage of using a \u201cper share\u201d metrics is the incorporation of the change in the number of outstanding stock(share dilution \u2013 more slices of cake \ud83d\ude41 / share repurchase \u2013 less slices of cake \ud83d\ude42 ). It is always good to check the revenue in order to understand if the business is growing (even slightly), if it is the case, shrinking the number of shares helps to further increase your ownership of the company profits. Otherwise, if the Revenues are drastically and inexorably declining, it could be a melting ice cube \u2013 red flag. More research is needed (some companies are declining but the gross margins are increasing as the case for BTI \u2013 Tobacco company). Be careful: in the extreme case of the liquidation of a company the Cash Flow could increase, but obviously is a liquidation process of a failing business (Value Trap), for that reason it is important to look at sales growth in the income statement. \u201cTeledyne return, which by averaging cash flow and net income for each business unit, emphasized cash generation and became the basis for bonus compensation for all business unit general managers.\u201d William N. Thorndike Jr., The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Succes A good management understands the importance of the Cash flow, and aligns the incentives of employees with those of the stockholders. Cash Flow Yield Market Capitalization / Free Cash Flow As we did with P/E,we have to take into account growth in our yield, as usual when it comes to growth we need to understand the story behind our numbers and it is always a good idea to be conservative. Cash Flow Yield = Mk cap / FCFE + growth There are two main ways to see a company: from the equity side (just shareholders), from the company side (what you would pay to buy the whole company = shares + debt). P/FCFE is the most common valuation from the point of view of the investors. P is the market capitalization so it ignores debt, and Cash Flow is the levered FCF. EV/FCFF evaluate the whole company, so it accounts for equity and debt, thus we will use the unlevered FCF. Why is the current Free Cash Flow isn\u2019t the whole story? I leave the Bezos\u2019 explanation: \u201cWith rare exceptions, the volume increase in the short-term is never enough to pay for the price decrease. However, our quantitative understanding of elasticity is short-term. We can estimate what a price reduction will do this week and this quarter. But we cannot numerically estimate the effect that consistently lowering prices will have on our business over five years or ten years. Our judgment is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long-term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.com. We have made similar judgments around Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime, both of which are expensive in the short term and \u2013 we believe \u2013 important and valuable in the long term.\u201d Jeff Bezos Tom Russo, a great investor, define it as \u201cThe capacity to suffer \u201d while describing an amazing business: \u201cWe tend to benefit in life when we sacrifice something today, to gain something tomorrow. That is true for companies. That is true for individuals.\u201d Tom Russo In other words, a good business sometimes sacrifices the short term margins and \u201ccash reward\u201d (FCF \u2192 Dividends/Buybacks) for shareholders in order to improve the MOAT (somebody says \u201cAlibaba\u201d?). As is the case of the first years of Amazon.com, when the smart CEO shared the profit with the customers (Costco is another good example), improving the sales volume or pouring tons of money in Research & Development with the goal to create a more efficient company which will pay more FCF in the future. As explained, efficiency and scale are the keys. If you remember, I often cite patience as a virtue of a good investor, this is why it is so important (long term horizon = wealth creation for society and for owners). Fig 9. As explained by Bezos, sacrificing short term free cash flow in favor of sales volume increases the long term gains. The caveat is the ability of the CEO to make the company profitable in the future, not always granted Walmart (WMT) is another good example, it went public in 1970. They generated positive earnings along the way. But they went FCF positive in 1997. If you had waited for Walmart to be capable of returning cash back to shareholders, you would have missed multiple hundred-baggers. Fig 10. Walmart historical price chart In the formula of FCF Yield, for example, the current FCF could be sacrificed in order to obtain more growth. That said, I reiterate the importance of connecting the numbers with the stories. The story with Amazon, it\u2019s about a brilliant CEO founder with lots of good ideas. Where, by investing all the cash available, he was able to generate and find future profitable projects, and a huge tailwind (e-commerce/cloud secular trend). Profitability is the key, but it is important remembering that is a by-product of sales growth in the long run. Fig 11. Buffett secret sauce of a winner system Depreciation and Amortization D&A are non-cash expenses, in other words the depreciation of an asset is an accounting figure created to match the expense with the related revenue generated by the contribution of the specific asset. Since the accounting nature of D&A does not really represent the cash influx, as we saw in the FCF section, we add the accounting figure, and we subtract the entire sum when the expense happens (CapEx). Stock based compensation (SBC) OCF added back SBC as a non-cash expense whereas net income subtract it. \u201cBuffett believes that the best boards are composed of relatively small groups (Berkshire has twelve directors) of experienced business people with large ownership stakes. (He requires that all directors have significant personal capital invested in Berkshire\u2019s stock.) He believes directors should have exposure to the consequences of poor decisions (Berkshire does not carry insurance for its directors) and should not be reliant on the income from board fees, which are minimal at Berkshire.\u201d The Outsiders Nassim Taleb proposed the notion of Skin in the Game. \u201cIf you do not take risks for your opinion, you are nothing.\u201d Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life Personally, I want a decision-maker (CEO) who loses money as I lose money. If s/he fails to make the right decision about the future of our business. This is called the principal-agent problem, and it arises when who makes the decision on an asset, s/he is not the same as who owns the assets, then the likelihood of a moral hazard increases. Openinsider.com permits to check buy and sell positions of management and employees. For example, Steve Jobs took a salary of $1 from 1997 to 2011. However, during this time his stocks increased from $17.5 million to $2.2 Billion. Another signal of skin in the game, is a founder leading a company, a founder who invests a lot of time and energy, his work and energy often goes further than the grit of a hired CEO. \u201cWe have ended up with a portfolio of owner-managed businesses as a byproduct of our assessment of the quality of the people involved. In other words, these managers earned their way into the portfolio. We feel slightly foolish for not recognizing this trait in advance, but, of course, we would have a bias toward founder-managed businesses (duh!).\u201d Nomad letters, Nicholas Sleep Usually stock buybacks are welcomed with exultation by investors, interpreted as a net gain for owners, the reality often is that these buybacks only compensated for the stock issued as a payoff for management and employees (nothing wrong with this, but SBC is a real expense). So far, I have spoken highly about buybacks (Berkshire Hathaway is good example), indeed I think share repurchase is a useful tool in order to reward shareholders, but you have to dig about the balance between share issuances and share repurchase in order to understand if there is a real gain for us, or only an escamotage, adding back SBC to OCF could be a viable alternative. \u201cTo say \u201cStock-Based Compensation\u201d is not an expense is even more cavalier. CEOs who go down that road are, in effect, saying to shareholders, \u201cIf you pay me a bundle in options or restricted stock, don\u2019t worry about its effect on earnings. I\u2019ll \u2018adjust\u2019 it away.\u201d Warren Buffett Cash flow from investing activities Fig 12. CF investing activity Damodaran Capital Expenditure I anticipated this figure in the section related to the Free Cash Flow, as already said, CapEx are the investments that companies make to grow or maintain the business. CapEx is depreciated in the Income statement over the useful life. Expenditures and expenses obviously depend on the sector, some sectors have high costs, caused by the need of a lot of raw material/buildings/marketing. A good example of a heavy capital expenditure sector is the airline business (other examples are automobile manufacturers, oil/gas production, steel, telecommunication, railways, \u2026). On the other hand, some businesses tied to software or web platforms, like for example Meta (Facebook), have low capital expenditure and high scalability (Asset light companies). Cash flow from financing activities Fig 12. CF financing activity Debt The debt section represents the issuance or repurchase of debts, it is useful to understand the capital structure of the business, issuance of debt increases the Cash Flow in the short-term, but with some caveats, risks and the effect of decreasing future Cash Flow by the amount needed to service the debt. It\u2019s important to understand the capital structure and be conservative when it comes to the value of the debt burden. It\u2019s also important to understand the purpose of the debt. I analyzed the debt question in the article on the Balance Sheet. As useful metric to understand at glance the sustainability of the debt burden is the following: Cash Flow to Debt = Cash Flow from Operations / Total Debt A high ratio suggests that a company is able to pay back its debt and consequently take on more debt if necessary, this metric varies widely across industries. Issuance/repurchase of common stock Issuance of common stocks could be a warning sign, as just explained, over time our goal is to own a biggest slice of the cake. If a company is overpriced an able management could issue more shares in order to obtain cash for investments, consequently this means that the shares are overpriced then we have to re-value our position. Here the notion to reiterate is that if the company has the chance to invest money in a high ROIC venture, it is better to do it than to repurchase the stocks, it\u2019s alway a matter of capital allocation and opportunity cost. Common dividend paid Cash Dividend Payout Ratio = Common Stock Dividends / (Cash Flow From Operation- Capital Expenditure) It\u2019s better to use Cash Flow because Earnings as an accounting figure is easily manipulated. Here it is worth paying attention to the % of FCF distributed as dividend, if the % is too high, or worse, it is more than the FCF, maybe the dividend if financed through debts, this is a warning sign. Financing a dividend with debt is the recipe for big problems and a warning sign. Value trap: a decadent business which tries to retain shareholders offering a juicy, but unsustainable dividend, maybe it works in a 0% interest environment, until the music stops. \u201cI have a certain distrust of firms with generous dividend policies, and so should you. Consider a firm with $5 million in \u201cexcess\u201d cash. If a healthy operation, it might use the money to fund research and development; or to lower the price of its product so as to increase market share; or for many other operations to enhance the value of the enterprise. Suppose, however, that it can\u2019t find anything in the company worth the investment. That firm might be thought of as having reached a dead end. And in such a case, it might increase the dividend to placate shareholders and stave off takeover artists.\u201d Quality of Earnings, Thornton L. O\u2019Glove That said, it is worth remembering that in every stage of the business life you can make good money, this always depends on the CEO\u2019s capital allocation ability and interest alignment aka Skin in the Game. \u201cPre-Paid Legal grew rapidly throughout the 1980s and 1990s. What\u2019s interesting about the company is that after this strong initial growth, its revenues have been virtually flat over the last ten years. This pattern of rapid growth followed by a sudden and extended flattening in results has historically been a recipe for horrific stock market returns. Over that same period of time, however, Pre-Paid\u2019s stock appreciated fourfold, dramatically outperforming both the market and its industry peers. How did the company achieve these results? Starting in late 1999, its CEO, Harland Stonecipher, realized that his market was maturing and that additional investments in growth were unlikely to have attractive returns. At the urging of his board (which, unusually for a public company, included several large investors), he began a systematic and aggressive program of optimizing free cash flow and systematically returning capital to shareholders through an aggressive stock repurchase program. Over the next twelve years, Stonecipher bought in over 50 percent of shares outstanding, to the sustained applause of his shareholders and the stock market, and in June 2011, agreed to sell his company to a private equity firm for a significant premium\u201d William N. Thorndike Jr., The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Succes Fig 14. Some examples of decreasing share counts through buybacks in a flat growth business. TSR (Total Shareholder Return) is not always a matter of sales growth. A share float shrink achieved through a share buyback is an excellent alternative for a stable FCF. Few or no opportunities to invest it at a compelling ROIC are usually a sign of the company\u2019s maturity stage. Net Change in cash Once we have all net cash balances (Operating, Investing, Financing) we sum them up and obtain the Net Cash for the given period, adding it to the opening cash balance and we arrive at the closing cash balance in the Balance Sheet under the Current Asset section (16. Balance Sheet Analysis). Here a summary of the cash inflow and outflow in a real case, followed by the context in the life stage of the company. Fig 15. Microsoft Cash Flow waterfall As usual, I attach the Damodaran chart of what we could expect as investors, in every stage of the company\u2019s life from a Cash Flow standpoint. Fig 16. Damodaran Cash Flow life cycle Key takeaway: Owner\u2019s Earnings EV/FCFF and CF yield as comparative metrics CFO to Debt as a sustainability metric Some free cash could be sacrifice today in order to widening the moat FCFE to calculate intrinsic value, remember it for the next chapeter 18. Intrinsic Value Share repurchase Vs SBC Well, we have finished the study of the three statements: 15. Income Statement Analysis 16. Balance Sheet Analysis 17. Cash Flow Analysis I tried to put some colors to these statements with an investing perspective. In the next article I will tell you what we learned until now, in order to define a range of prices for the companies we are analyzing. As I anticipated, I give importance to the future cash flow of the company, but future cash does not have the same value as the cash in our pocket today. \u201cA bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\u201d Warren Buffett In other words, a sum of money is worth more now than the same sum will be at a future date, because of uncertainty and opportunity cost, meaning the opportunity to invest in other companies with better cash flow related to their price. The future is inherently uncertain and we have to understand which investment gives us the best mixture from a risk/reward standpoint.

Noah\u2019s ark In the first part of our overview, we analyzed the income statement, now we are going to look at the capital structure of our business, namely: the balance sheet. If earnings are our engine, the balance sheet is the frame of our machine. I like using allegory to make the point, in this case a good one could be the hull of a boat. In the holy bible Noah was a God\u2019s prophet, in his days the God warned Noah about the advent of a catastrophic flooding, and he ordered him to build a boat in order to survive. God gives to Noah the technical specificity of the ark. Time passes but there is always an upcoming apocalypse to worry about, it is the cyclical nature of our universe. If we invest for the long run, our boat has to survive financial floods and storms, in other words: bubbles and bust (Article Stock Market Crash). There are some characteristics that make our boat apocalypse-proof. We always hear about financial crises, our duty is not to anticipate these events (it is quite impossible), rather, it is to be on board the right boat. When the flood comes the action to do isn\u2019t throw yourself out in the middle of the storm, instead, choose the right boat before the storm comes, and never leave them and rather give it more \u201cfinancial fuel\u201d, \u201cour money\u201d. \u201cEvery decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it\u2019s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying wash tubs, not teaspoons\u201d Warren Buffett What we are going to learn: Understand the meaning of the balance sheet Read a balance sheet statement at a glance Focus on fundamental numbers and extrapolate some metrics Contextualize the number within the business maturation stage Email Address In the first part of my article 15. income statements analysis, we spoke about the predictability of the future earnings. Predictability is warranted by the company\u2019s competitive advantage (Article 14. it\u2019s a war). The MOAT is principally tied to our story and confirmed by the past performance, the track record which gives us insight on the management ability to conduct the business. Today, we analyze the present structure of the business, as God gives Noah instruction on how to build the ark. We are going to dig into the key figures that tell us if the company can survive a financial storm. When the monetary and fiscal policy are relaxed, even weak companies survive, as is the case nowadays with low interest rates and quantitative easing environment, but what happens if something changes and the financial environment becomes hostile? We need a business which can survive in two types of environment: liquidity contraction and/or highly inflationary (5.1 Appendix \u2013 Currency Value). We cannot predict the macro events nor timing the market, but we can do an engineering valuation of our boat. If the hull of the boat is not solid, we are not going to see the future cash flow of our business. After this intro, let\u2019s go to check if our boat has some leaks. \u201cIt is well to consider the financial strength and debt structure to see if a few bad years would hinder the company\u2019s long-term progress.\u201d Peter Lynch Lynch also refers to the Balance Sheet as a \u201cSurvivability factor\u201d. fig 2. Facebook 2020 Balance Sheet source: Edgar Foundation. The balance sheet shows what a company owns and owes, and how much shareholders have invested in. The formula: Assets = Liabilities + Equity Fig 3. Formula This is the basic formula of the balance sheet equilibrium, and it is the alloy that makes up the hull of our boat. Assets Anything of value, which has a cash value and/or generates cash, i.e.: cash, buildings, infrastractures,.. A few examples: Company = farm\u2019s truck: utilized to grow oats which once sold generate cash. Individual = house: rented for income Note: Usually, if inflation goes up, the value of assets already in place go up compared to the book value (replacement cost). Liabilities Something (i.e., assets) owed to somebody else. An example: Every sort of debt, often used to finances the acquisition of an assets, which will generate cash to repaid the debt interest, and generate additional income (e.g., mortgage) Here we can note the importance of producing more earnings than the cost of the obligation (interest rate) aka Return On Capital employed. If not, the company is burning cash. In other words, if I assume a debt of 100 and I have to pay an 1% interest, and I use this money to develop a project which returns < 1%, we are paying more, respect to our return, that is called Value Destruction. I will go into the details in the Ratio Section of this article. Examples: commercial paper, bills, notes, bonds, etc. An advice by the GOAT \u201cCompanies that have no debt can\u2019t go bankrupt.\u201d Peter Lynch \u201cFirst rules of investing, never lose money\u201d Warren Buffett Here the importance of capital structure, bankruptcy is one of the few cases where you could lose all of your money overnight, the rest is stock volatility. Even if the company manages to service its debt, this payment decreases the cash flow available to pay shareholders. When a company downsizes its debt burden, it releases money for shareholders: dividends, repurchases and investments. Remember: the true nature of investing regards the money the company pays us, not the price set by Mr. Market. (article 8. Mr Market) Equity Simply put, this is your piece of the cake. What amount of money, hypothetically, would be returned to you as an owner if the company would be liquidated. Equity can also be called book value. For some sectors or businesses, book value per share can be a useful metric (notoriously in the past Warren Buffett buybacks $BRK stock under 1.2 times book value, as a sort of proxy to define the intrinsic value, indeed a smooth growth in equity could be a good sign). Example: individual = Equity is what belongs to you after you deduct the mortgage of your house from the total value, that\u2019s the Equity of your home. It is composed by two essential parts: Original investment and later investment Retaining earnings: is the percentage of profit that was not paid as dividend/buybacks, accumulated overtime and can be reinvested for new projects and acquisition or used to pay off debt. As usual there is not a magic formula. However, in the example of the previous article, the best companies don\u2019t need external fuel, but those companies use their profit as fuel. In other words they are self-financed. Another example: Alibaba uses e-commerce main business as a fuel generator for AliCloud and Venture Capitalist investment not yet profitable. You can see the potential of a business that has excess cash to deploy in a series of new projects, even in uncharted and risky territory. These ventures are named optionality and companies like this are named spawners. Based on the description by Mohnish Pabrai, a spawner is a company with \u201cDNA, which reflects a deep conviction in the importance of relentlessly adding and incubating new businesses that have the potential to be massive growth engines.\u201d As every equation we can extrapolate the variable we want to calculate, for example: Shareholders\u2019 Net Worth (Equity) = Assets \u2013 Liabilities If we divide it by the number of shares we obtain the book value per share (bvps). BVPS = Shareholders equity / number of shares. Now it is clear why the Balance sheets are useful and important, because they define what we own, as investors. Intangible Something forgotten by accounting is the importance of intangible assets, namely the money spent by the company in order to develop new technologies (Research & Development R&D) for developing a brand (Sales, General and Administrative SG&A), for training specialized labor forces (COGS) or create a new intellectual property. These items are not capitalized (transformed into an asset then depreciated overtime), but those intangibles have a long term value, mostly in our tech oriented society. In other words, this money spent will generate real assets, even if they are not represented in the balance sheet, rather those intangible assets are treated as cost and immediate expense. Brand, franchising, trained labor, intellectual property, customer lists, reputation, culture, loyal employees, data, those are only some examples which share some of the features of physical assets, and they can generate cash flow over time. Mickey Mouse could be a good example. Mickey was the creation of two brilliant minds, Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. These two guys have spent energy in order to draw and develop this character, in the form of time, money and brain power. This energy has been converted into one of the most notorious and valuable fictional characters of all time, imagine how much money $DIS extrapolate from this creative work (e.g., comics, books, parks, merchandising,\u2026). \u201cin 1966 people said \u201cWell, Mary Poppins is terrific this year, but they [Disney] are not going to have another Mary Poppins next year, so the earnings will be down.\u201d I don\u2019t care if the earnings are down like that. You know you\u2019ve still got Mary Poppins to throw out in seven more years, assuming kids squawk a little. I mean there\u2019s no better system than to have something where, essentially, you get a new crop every seven years and you get to charge more each time.\u201d Warren Buffett We all know how many cash crops Disney made over the last 70 years thanks to the large number of characters owned by the company. Intellectual properties could be an eternal money mine with the difference that a mine needs physical infrastructures which in turns needs maintenance, Mickey not. Furthermore nobody else can own a Mickey Mouse. What does this mean? In an inflationary environment, your maintenance/replacements costs are going to increase, reducing the profit margin, that doesn\u2019t happen with IP (intellectual property). Other than that, its life expectancy is sustained by its current age, as it is the case for Mickey (Lindy effect). Then rather than depreciate, often intangibles gain value proportionally to their age, the passage of time crystallizes the brand recognition in the customers minds, namely mindshare, a notion already discussed in the past article. In this sense, also my blog is an intangible asset, my hope is to create something that can generate value for the readers and last over time. Fig 4. Mickey mouse in command of our ship \u201cI only hope that we never lose sight of one thing \u2013 that it was all started by a mouse\u201d Walt Disney, Disneyland, October 27, 1954 Where the intellectual works of Disney are presented in its balance sheet? Obviously this is an extreme example. But it is worth noting that the Disney empire is founded on assets which do not appear on the balance sheet, it will appear only if someone, in a hypothetical future, will buy Disney. Because of the earnings power, the buyer will have to pay a premium over the equity. This premium is named Goodwill, but doesn\u2019t exist in the previous balance sheet of the acquired company, because the assets are not tangible. Another example: FaceBook/Instagram/Whatsapp \u2013 Network effect. (Thanks Zuck!) Does it remind you of something? MOAT? Be careful, it seems that the secret sauce of a great business does not lie in a figure of the balance sheet. (Article 14. it\u2019s a war) As a reminder of the last article. Income statement analysis, it is useful to remember that profit earned by a business and reported in the income statement are also recorded in the balance sheet,and it increases the Retained earnings figure under the equity section. Balance sheet lines analyze Made the necessary premises, now is time to analyze the balance sheet lines. Fig 5. Capital structure source: Professor Aswath Damodaran Assets Current assets Assets expected to be used by business operations in the next 12 months. Include: Cash and cash equivalents, account receivable, inventory, marketable security and other liquid assets. Cash and cash equivalent. These are assets owned by the company that are cash or can be converted into cash immediately (e.g., marketable security). How much cash is it good to have? As usual there is not a unique answer, but from what I saw, it\u2019s always a good thing. Mostly during prosperity periods, to accumulate some cash. That is because when a storm arrives, cash gives us fuel to weather the storm, and other than that, if our CEO is a great capital allocator, he will take advantage of the crisis acquiring assets at a discount and consequently with a high Return on Investment (ROI). Even a great company will suffer damage during a storm, the goal is survive and thrive in the post flood environment. Usually after a storm, weak companies drown, and the industry consolidates, permitting the fittest to thrive and acquiring good assets. \u201cAntifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.\u201d Nassim Nicolas Taleb That does not mean it is good to hoard an exaggerated quantity of money, but if there is not a great opportunity it is better to retain some cash, at minimum some cash or liquid assets sufficient to cover short liabilities. \u201cWe just want to get through the typhoon, and we\u2019d rather come out of it with a whole lot of liquidity\u201d Charlie Munger referring to Berkshire Hathaway $BRK Finally, I want to remind you of a fundamental principle of investing, we, as investors, buy a business not a stock. Often, a market crisis is caused by a liquidity contraction (e.g. increases interest -> decreases circulating money -> average Joe: \u201cI sell my s&p 500 index in the worst moment possible because I\u2019ve to refinance my liabilities at a high rate then I need some money\u201c, this phenomenon causes also the stock price of good company to nosedive, a great management with money at hand will buybacks stocks and that permits us to increase our slice of the pie (7. How company reward us). And you have to do the same, increase your stakes in great companies! \u201cIn the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity\u201d Sun Tzu Account Receivable Account Receivables (AR) are debts owed to the company by its customers for goods or service already delivered. If it grows overtime, it could be the sign that customers are unable or unwilling to pay, a warning sign that is worth digging. If the AR are too low it could be a sign of the company\u2019s rigidity in its payment terms to its customers. The risk is that the company will not be able to recover the money due, forcing the company to write off the AR. Inventory Raw materials, work in process and finished goods. A company has in its stock that material will ultimately be sold. When an item is sold, its carrying cost transfers to the COGS Cost Of Good Sold(article income statement). How to value inventory. Holding an inventory as a cost, moreover products tend to become obsolete (think about the inventory with iPhone when Apple throws out a new model). Consequently it is better to have a quick turnover cycle depending on the industry. Inventory turnover: COGS / Average inventory. The results tell us how many times per year a company sold its entire inventory. Inventory growth > Sales growth = red flag. Warning: an inventory turnover too high can mean that the company does not have sufficient inventory to cover the demands. \u201cExamples abound of how considerable increases in inventory and/or accounts receivable can forecast downward earnings and surprises. This is especially true in those industries subject to rapid changes in products and taste. Expect to find them in companies dealing with high fashion, seasonal goods, and especially high tech. No investor seriously involved with stocks in these industries can afford to ignore accounts receivable and inventories.\u201d Thorton L. O\u2019Glove, Quality of Earnings Deferred tax assets This asset is usually created when a business incurs a loss in a financial year (NOL: Net Operating Loss) or a company overpaid or paid in advance taxes. It can be carried over indefinitely and can be used to reduce future tax liability. Non-current assets Noncurrent assets are assets tangible or intangible that will benefit the company for more than one year. PP&E, long term investment, goodwill. Gross Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) Tangible long term assets also known as Fixed Assets: machinery, computers, office equipment, vehicles, furniture, buildings, lands. Accumulated depreciation As explained in the last article (15. Income statements analysis) is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, this involves the reduction of its accounting value. Net PP&E The results from the depreciation of our assets over time. Gross PP&E \u2013 Accumulated depreciation. In other words, the remaining accounting value of our physical assets. As you can imagine, this is an accounting trick, some assets behave in an opposite manner, gaining value over time. Some investors are specialized in finding this type of imbalance, where the value of the asset is more than its accounting value. Peter Lynch named them \u201cAsset Play\u201d, the same notion can be applicable to the intangible assets which are not even presented. \u201cConsider tor example that generally accepted accounting principles permit a firm to write of a factory over 20 years, using straight line depreciation. Suppose the property cost $20 million originally. Would you say it was worth only $5 million after fifteen years? That is what the company\u2019s books would indicate, but given the nature of the real estate market, that building might fetch $30 million or more. Yet every year the firm deducted an item of $1 million lor factory depreciation, when perhaps it would have been more realistic to add a million for appreciation.\u201d Quality of earnings, Thornton L. O\u2019glove Long term investment Like us, companies also invest in securities such as: stocks, bonds, real estate, cash. This investment is intended to be held for more than a year. Goodwill I explained goodwill in the last article. A \u201cgoodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not.\u201d The balance sheet represents the present value of this intangible asset netted by impairments. A warning sign could be a high percentage of goodwill over assets, it\u2019s worth digging on the capital allocation ability of the CEO. For example, if a company pays $1 mio to buy another company that has net assets of $500k, they are going to have $500k of goodwill on their balance sheet. The net assets that they have acquired for $500k cost to them more than if they are to buy the business components separately. If it turns out that the whole acquired company doesn\u2019t generate the expected Cash Flow over time, they would need to start impairing the goodwill asset. If a company keeps acquiring assets or entire companies and later they regularly charge impairment related to them, it\u2019s a red flag, you have to dig on this or pass. Instead if impairments are sporadic events, say one in the last 5 years, it may not be a major problem. Liabilities Current liabilities Short term financial obligations that are due in the next 12 months, including account payable, deferred revenue, short term debt, dividends, notes payable, taxes owed. Account Payable Account payables (AP) are amounts due to suppliers for services or goods received, but not yet paid. It is a sort of short term loan, indeed lengthening the payment time is a source of cash for the company. AP are the liabilities counterpart of the AR (Account Receivables), previously analyzed. Deferred/unearned revenue Advance payments: a company received service/products not yet delivered. Not represented in the income until service/product will be delivered, but it will be shown in the cash flow statement when cash is received. Revenue recognition means that the revenue can only be recognized when the revenue process is complete, payment has been made and the good/service has been delivered. A common example could be a subscription-based product or services that require prepayments. Short term borrowing Financial obligations that are expected to be paid within a year. Non current liabilities Financial obligations that are not due within the upcoming year, long term debt and leases. Long term debt Debts are not necessarily bad, but could become a big problem. Debt is useful and its scope is to generate wealth in our society. A good starting point in order to understand the role of debt is a video made by Ray Dalio (How economic machine works). However, debt is a social problem. When an individual, a business or a society brings more debt than is productive output, there could be a problem (unless you are the reserve currency printer, namely US, but this is another story \u2013 Lyn Alden Petrodollar). Fig 6. Public US debt % GDP Interest rates are low then, having some debt, could be a good idea, but only if that more money is used to generate wealth in the long term. For example, having a huge pile of debts and paying high dividends to the shareholders may seem a good idea, but in reality is the sign of a myopic management with a short term vision. High level of debt means high level of interest to pay, this interest will reduce the cash our business can pay to us as owners, moreover this debt burden must be rapaid sooner or later, reducing future cash generation. Some companies rather than lower their dividend and lose their investors, those companies use debt to payout dividends, that increases debt services and reduces the future gain. In other words, it is the action of a short-sighted management and it will be detrimental for long term shareholders. It is useful to compare cash and long term debt in order to understand how much net debt the company has. Why do some companies have cash and debt? There are many reasons. The first reason is the tax advantage. Another reason worth noting is that some companies are international, then they have assets in foreign currency exposed to local devaluation risks to compensate for this devaluation the company takes a debt in the same currency, in order to take advantage of local currency devaluation without trapping money in countries with weak currency. Leases Lease is a contract between two parties, where the lessee pays the lessors for an asset use. Be careful, capital leases are counted as liabilities. A new FASB rule, effective Dec. 15, 2018, requires that all leases unless they are shorter than 12 months must be recognized on the balance sheet. Number of common stock We have already discussed the notion of share repurchases (how companies reward us). I want to highlight an aspect, companies not only repurchase shares, but sometimes they issue new fresh stocks, having the opposite effect: namely diluting the stocks count thus devaluing the value of a single stock. You can think that: stocks are like money, a store of value. Companies can pay investors, employees or even what they need with stocks. We, as investors gain, when there are fewer stocks, because in this manner we own a big piece of the cake. On the other hand the management could pay itself and the employer with stocks (Stock Based Compensation). Nothing wrong about it, if employees and management are themselves owners could mean that they act like owners in the interest of us, as investors. This is a complex argument that needs a separate article, but it is worth remembering for the next article where we are going to analyze the cash flow. Other than that it is good to look at the number of share counts over time in order to understand if the company is diluting our earning participation. The management must treat shares as if they are gold bullions, nothing wrong using stock as a currency, but only if the exchange is worth our gold bullions. Fig 7. $AAPL How a good CEO makes his shareholders rich through share repurchases managing the balance sheet When you are trying to catch the last overpriced hot stock with uncertain financial future, remember this chart and think about how the wealth is created. Wealth is created over time by a cash machine business and a management aligned with shareholder interest! (Berkshire Hathaways $BRK case study) Since Tim Cook became CEO of Apple 10 years ago the stock soared 1022% (ten bagger). Net Working Capital (NWC) The NWC is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. NWC tells us the operational efficiency of the business, in other word the ability to reduce the costs and improve the gain in the short term transaction. If a company has positive working capital, it means that it has the ability to invest money in the business. The goal is to cover operating expenses while using assets in the most productive manner. As usual, one of the most important goals is resource optimization. NWC = Current Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities A negative working capital suggests there will be trouble to pay the short term debts. The consequence could be the reduction of Cash Flow in order to weather the short term liquidity issues. Ratios and metrics Ratios are useful to compare the historical data and data between companies, it is worth remembering that capital structure can vary between sector and maturation stage (e.g., Some capital intensive sectors have a huge debt burden. That could be a normal or a mature company with stable earnings that could have an high credit rating, thus this will pay much less in borrowing costs. ) Fig 8. Company life stages source: Prof Aswath Damodaran The table on fig. 8 by Prof Aswath Damoradan is useful to contextualize the figures, every stage of the life of the company has its optimal blend of assets/debt/equity. Return on Equity (ROE) ROE measures the financial performance and corporate profitability of assets owned by investors. It is useful to define the ability of the management to make profit with our money. It defines how much profit is generated for each shareholder dollar. Earnings growth can never exceed ROE. Be careful, a high ROE is not a guarantee of growth. ROE = Net income / average shareholders\u2019 equity \u201cFocus on Return on Equity, not earnings per share\u201d Warren Buffett Be wary, in order to understand the results we have to know the capital structure. Basically, if equity is the result of Assets \u2013 liabilities, the more liabilities we have the higher is the ROE. Keep in mind, there is not a magic formula, but we need a holistic approach. Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Similar to ROE but with a different denominator, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is used to evaluate the capital allocation ability on total available capital. ROA = Net income /Total assets ROIC = Net income / (Debt + Equity) ROIC > Cost Of Capital = Value Creation ROIC < Cost Of Capital = Value Destruction The deal is finding a business which produces a high ROIC, and it can deploy all its earned cash at the same high ROIC, this would be a legendary business. Unfortunately businesses like that are very rare, indeed Buffett structured the Berkshire Hathaway holding using cash generated by high ROIC business in new projects with high ROIC, here is where the power of compounding takes form(article link compounding). Usually High ROIC businesses deploy this cash to payout dividend or repurchase shares, in the worst case those will deploy cash in low ROIC businesses destroying value through \u201cdiworsification\u201d (over expansion of a company into new projects it does not fully understand and which does not align with the competencies of the management/outside circle of competence. Reference: One Upon Wall Street, Peter Lynch) Time Warner AOL example \u201cAOL Time Warner (2001\u20132003)\u201d Fig 9. ROIC table return source: McKinsey \u201cOver the long term, it\u2019s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you\u2019re not going to make much difference than a 6% return\u2014even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you\u2019ll end up with a fine result.\u201d Charlie Munger Fig 10. High P/E returns source: Terry Smith Fund \u2013 L\u2019Oreal, Altria Group, The Hershey Company, Colgate Fig 11. ROIC \u2013 L\u2019Oreal, Altria Group, The Hershey Company, Colgate Please Note: Fund Smith\u2019s table represents returns from 1973 while my ROIC data have a limited timeframe, however consider that usually overtime ROIC tends to decrease because competitors are attracted by high profits, and enter into market and subtracts returns from the incumbent. However, if a company has a competitive advantage, the MOAT will protect the ROIC. Even if you pay a high price, over the long term if you buy a great company with a high return on capital your Total Shareholder Return (TSR) will be good. It is worth remembering that these metrics are alway past looking, in other words we are looking at past performance. Past data are useful to understand the management ability, but they are not certainties for future returns. \u201cIn the business world, unfortunately, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the windshield.\u201d Warren Buffett This means two things: The art of investing is the ability to use past numbers and stories to help us to hypothesize the existence of a MOAT, and the ability of the management to defend and improve this MOAT over time. That is the secret to maintaining the past performances. We, as investors, use this data and our future outlook to choose the investment with the best probabilistic chance to realize a gain. For that reason I\u2019m obsessed with the idea of finding companies with a wide competitive advantage. The past uses of capital is a responsibility of the management and condition of the past. It is entirely possible that the recent Capital Allocation has become better or worse, but our metrics pay the price of past weak decisions (e.g., if management in the past overpay for an asset, this excess can weigh on the balance sheet). Ideally, we want to assess the present capital allocation decision, but almost always, we have the data of the entire asset\u2019s story of the business, and we can\u2019t assess the Return of Capital for every single project. Debt to Equity D/E = Debt / Equity It is important to highlight: the ideal debt to equity proportion depends on the sector and the maturity stage of the company. A ratio of 2 or higher is considered risky. Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) Company ability to service its debts obligations ICR = Earnings before interest and taxes / Interest expenses A ICR of 1.5 is considered the minimum acceptable. Note: Interest expenses are shown in the cash flow statement, we will analyze it in the next article. Quick Ratio (Acid Test) Company ability to to pay down current debt using near cash assets. QR = (Cash + Securities + Receivables) / Current Liabilities Ideally a company should have a ratio of 1 or higher. Enterprise Value (EV) The Enterprise value offers a more comprehensive and clear picture of the real value of a company. EV enterprise value = total debt + market capitalization \u2013 cash Basically is how much is needed to buy the entire company. The EV could be an useful tool to analyze the business from a different perspective, and helps investors to have a broad vision on the capital structure of the business. It is useful to compare business in the same industry. Fig 11. Enterprise Value Enterprise value (EV) / operating earnings (EBIT) EV/EBIT A ratio below 10 is retained cheap. I want to highlight the thought of one of the most influential economists of the 20th century: \u201cIn chemistry and physics and other natural sciences the object of experiment is to fill in the actual values of the various quantities and factors appearing in an equation or a formula; and the work when done is once and for all. In economics that is not the case, and to convert a model into a quantitative formula is to destroy its usefulness as an instrument of thought.\u201d JM Keynes Investing is an art, formulas are useful, but the complexity of investing cannot be captured by a mathematical formula. Note: Financial sector has different rules (outside my circle of competence), within this sector high level debt could be normal. In the next chapter I am going to focus on what shareholders really care about: cash available for operations and investments! That is the Cash Flow statements, stay tuned!

It is not intended as a substitute for legal, commercial and/or financial advice from a licensed professional. Here we go! The first thing to do is recovering the financial statements of the company that we have chosen. A good idea is to choose a company within our circle of competence (10. Circle of competence). What we are going to learn: Read an income statement at a glance Focus on the fundamental numbers Extrapolate some metrics Contextualizing the numbers Email Address The goal is to find the best compounder with a competitive advantage. As in the previous article, I will take, again, Facebook (FB) as an example. The first thing to do is to go on Google and digitize \u201cFB investor relations\u201d. Once we are in the investor page we have to open the last earnings release and search for the Statements of Income. Like I explained in the preceding article (12. Starting Point), there are plenty of platforms that allow us to retrieve the data in a more comfortable set up (e.g. quickfs.net or tikr.com). It is always a good thing to check the datas on official sources like EDGAR. EDGAR is the official SEC (US Security and exchange commission) where we can find official documents on companies. US gov EDGAR The best tool we need for developing quantitative analysis are the Financial statements, remember the past article about stories and numbers. (11. Stories and numbers) \u201cAccounting is the language of business\u201d Warren Buffett When I started my journey in the world of investing, I was afraid about accounting. I started with zero knowledge about this language, but I rapidly noted that not all data is useful. At least, to start, we can have a first idea about a company by looking at a few numbers. If your knowledge about accounting is zero or very minimal, I\u2019ll suggest you to read: \u201cWarren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements: The Search for the Company with a Durable Competitive Advantage\u201d by Mary Buffett Or, if you prefer an educational video: A series of educational videos realized by Prof. Aswath Damoradan (Stern University, NY) Accounting 101 With the following example, I want to analyze with you some useful financial figures, easy to understand even without a CFA. Our aim is to become practitioner investors, not employees of an accounting firm. My goal is to distill the meaningful parts of the process, in order to craft our thesis in a simple manner without too much noise (First principle thinking, remember, when we will talk about Mental models). The final destination is to find companies with strong competitive advantage (14. It\u2019s a war) at a fair price, to buy, hold and let them compound over the long term. \u201cIf the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is almost never.\u201d Phil Fisher Fig.1 Facebook $FB income statement The best is to analyze multiple years of financial, 10 years ideally. In this manner, we can track the number history of the company, and glimpse the evolution over time. In other words, it defines if the company is in healthy condition, and if it is growing overtime. It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand. Fig.3 World War 2 Coca Cola advertising campaign \u201cTo see that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for 5 cents, wherever he is and whatever it costs the Company.\u201d Robert Woodruff, $KO president, 1923-1954 Fig. 4 Coca Cola\u2019s Santa \u201cBefore 1931, there were many different depictions of Santa Claus around the world, including a tall gaunt man and an elf \u2014 there was even a scary Claus. But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin. There are tons of numbers and metrics useful, but we have only one brain, so the best thing to do is try to cut down our cognitive load. \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Albert Einstein That\u2019s my goal with this blog. Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d William N. Thorndike, The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success Finally, net income must be positive! I remember you, our purpose is to find the best company and don\u2019t lose money. More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond. From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.). Time will judge if you made a good choice. It\u2019s always about the allocation of capital. \u201cIf you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings \u2014 assuming the company in question has earnings. As you\u2019ll see in this text, I subscribe to the crusty notion that sooner or later earnings make or break an investment in equities. What the stock price does today, tomorrow, or next week is only a distraction.\u201d Peter Lynch Fig 7. Earnings and capital gain are historically correlated (that\u2019s investing!) As you can see in fig. 6, Lynch\u2019s point is supported by the datas. Like humans, businesses have a life cycle, it\u2019s important to understand where our company stands in its life cycle. Fig 8. Business cycle source: prof Damodaran It\u2019s useful knowing in which stage of its life the company is, in order to better understand the key metrics and what we have to expect the management must do to maximise shareholders returns. This is my semplify thought process through the income statement. Remember that, every industry is different and there are different metrics to focus on, anyway I am trying to summarize the most important factor in the future. I will revisit my analysis of statements with a more granular focus. To be honest, I consider the income statements the least useful of all statements. It\u2019s useful in order to interpret Cash Flow, for example an healthy cash generation depends on increased profits, thanks to income statements we can see the past sales trend. In the Cash flow statement we will see how these sales are converted into real cash. Balance sheet, that is the second statement we will discover! Stay tuned! Warning: All statements represent the past of the company, as investors we need to understand the sustainability of cash generation in the future, in order to do that we need to understand the stories behind our company (11. Stories and numbers) Remember, our goal is to find outstanding business, buy at the right price and hold for the long run. \u201cPut together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years, and so also will the portfolio\u2019s market value.\u201d Warren Buffett Feel free to comment, share my article with friends and subscribe to my newsletter if you like my content and you want to follow me towards financial freedom.

Fig. 1 1929 Magazine headline I am taking care to warn my followers about the notion of bubbles and the consequential crash. Email Address What\u2019s a bubble? Occasionally Mr Market (8. Mr Market) tends to become too exuberant about the future of the market or more often one specific sector. The most recent and known bubble was the dotcom bubble. At the end of the 90s it became evident that informatic technology was going to be a game changer. People start to lose their mind about every company that rhymes with .com or dot or @ or every other synonymous of computer science. Lose their mind = Paying high price for unprofitable companies that maybe will provide cash in a far future Fig 2. NASDAQ chart during dotcom bubble and beyond Fig. 3 Xerox \u201cthe darling\u201d chart Noting that most of the dotcom darlings never return to the previous level (in other words a lot of investors lose tons of money). It\u2019s important to understand a simple, but sometimes not correctly understood, principle: If you lose 50% you must gain 100% to return to the previous wealth status. How to avoid being caught in a bubble? Stick with fundamentals and your circle of competence (10. Circle of competence). Invest in a company that you know and that generates cash now. The problem with bubbles is the exuberance generated by future expectations. What I see today is a exuberance about electric vehicles.(Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla) \u201cNow, there\u2019s just so much money injected into the markets and the economy that the markets are like a casino with people playing with funny money. They\u2019re buying all sorts of things and pushing yields on everything down. Now you have stocks that have gone up, and you have classic bubble dynamics in so many different assets.\u201d Ray Dalio \u2013 Why in the World Would You Own Bonds Peter Lynch cocktail party theory Stage 1: At the party, the markets have been down a while and people are not talking about stocks. There\u2019s little interest in talking to an equity mutual fund manager like Lynch about it. When folks generally seem inclined to talk about plaque with a dentist than about stocks it\u2019s likely the market is about to head higher. Stage 2: People may talk about stocks long enough to say they\u2019re risky but would still rather not talk about it. Party conversations are still more plaque than stocks and the market\u2019s up roughly 15%. Few care. Stage 3: Market is up 30%, people start asking a professional money manager like Lynch what stocks to buy. Most have now bought a stock or two. Stage 4: People are crowded around Lynch but now they are telling Lynch what stocks to buy. Dentists are now offering stock tips. This stage is a good sign the market is near the top. Look around you, if you see this pattern, start to worry. Especially if you find yourself in the role of party guest. \u201cWhenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.\u201d Mark Twain Why does the bubble happen? \u201cThe symmetry between prediction and explanation is destroyed because the future is genuinely uncertain, and therefore cannot be predicted with the same degree of certainty as it can be explained in retrospect.\u201d George Soros Bubble is a good example of Soros\u2019s Reflexivity. The Stock Market is a forecast machine, the agents involved in the machine constantly try to predict the future (or define it?). If Mr Market sees a disruptive technology coming, pheraps is not wrong in the direction but in the magnitude and timing. Sometimes, after a bubble, the sector consolidates and only the fit survive, companies that will thrive after the bust. It\u2019s even possible in accordance with Soros\u2019s principle that when a huge amount of capital is directed to a specific sector, the future of this sector becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Capital inflow + media coverage in a specific sector or company allows the company to grow more strong and pave the way to a increased number of investment prospects that would be impossible if Mr Market doesn\u2019t become irrational about it. Fig 4. Reflexivity source: George Soros However, fulfilled or not, this exuberance anticipation of events doesn\u2019t pay. Remember that someone is still waiting to regain the money lost during the dotcom bubble. \u201cRule Number One: Never Lose Money. Rule Number Two: Never Forget Rule Number One\u201d Warren Buffett We are rational investors, we want to grow our wealth, we invest in businesses which generate great returns for us. In order to do that, we don\u2019t need to anticipate the future, but we are going to invest when the future comes. We will lose $AMZN at 2 usd/share? Maybe, but we are going to avoid losing 100% of our wealth in any of the other hundreds of companies lost in the dotcom collapse. Our duty, as Super investors (9. Value investing), is to buy companies that already generate profit, and because of their MOAT, those are going to generate more organic profits in the future. \u201cYes, but my neighbour is becoming rich thanks to an innovative EV company. His stock skyrocketed and he told me to buy it now!\u201d Average Joe Remember the Xerox chart and the chart about GoPro I presented in the article Case Study 1 Tesla, remember Peter Lynch analogy. There is no free lunch in investing, do your due diligence. \u201cThe market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.\u201d Benjamin Graham Remember, when the market collapses, and the bubble deflates, it\u2019s possible that even good companies follow the price trend, don\u2019t go panic mode, revisit your investing thesis and if the facts about fundamentals are solid, go out and buy the discounted shares of your favourite business. \u201cEvery decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it\u2019s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.\u201d Warren Buffett As I have predicted in the article Article Case Study 2 \u2013 Berkshire, Buffett did what every great CEO must do when his stock undervalued, that is repurchased his own share creating value for shareholders. Fig. 5 $BRK stock chart during Buffett repurchases This means I\u2019ve to invest only when bubbles pop? Nope, your duty, as an investor, is to find bargains in every market condition, but in the meantime avoid being caught in the fad of the moment. If you can\u2019t find a bargain tied to your circle of competence, there is nothing wrong with sitting on your cash waiting. \u201cAll human unhappiness comes from one single thing. Not knowing how to remain at rest in a room.\u201d Blaise Pascal At the end, a crash is only a chance to take more shares in a business we love for a discounted price. Is it possible to forecast a bubble or even better a bust? No. I read tons of articles about bubbles and more in general the possibility to predict the market, the reality is that is impossible. \u201cTime in the market beats timing the market\u201d Old saying Or, as said by Peter Lynch \u201cFar more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves.\u201d Peter Lynch Applying the occam\u2019s razor my advice is simply: Try to find a bargain, if you don\u2019t find one, stay in cash. To do that you need to understand the business stories and numbers (11. Stories and numbers). \u201cThe first rule of an investment is: Don\u2019t lose. And the second rule of investment is: Don\u2019t forget the first rule. And that\u2019s all the rules there are. I mean, if you buy things for far below what they\u2019re worth, and you buy a group of them, you basically don\u2019t lose money.\u201d Warren Buffett Feel free to comment, share my article with friends and subscribe to my newsletter if you like my content and you want to follow me towards financial freedom.

Medieval village allocated in a strategic defensive position \u2013 Pitigliano, Grossetto (Tuscany, Italy) Photographer: Jenny \u201cIn business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats\u201d Warren Buffett Capitalism is like life, it is a war. Our goal is to find the best fortress where to put our capital, ideally a fortress with a wide moat, and a smart and powerful lord.In the course of human history, battlegrounds have changed but not the nature of humans, we can\u2019t neglect our nature, we are born to fight because throughout the fight we built a better and enhanced society. This is exactly the purpose of capitalism, and we are all involved in this mechanics.It\u2019s possible to simply become lazy and stop fighting, typically that happens at the peak of a civilization (i.e US trade deficit). Then another civilization takes over, and lets the old one die.Look around you, most of the western products, brands, lands are now owned by asian and developing countries. Why does this happen? Because they want to fight. (e.g. 100% Volvo and 10% Mercedes-Benz owned by Geely (China), lands and buildings in Milan \u2013 COIMA RES owned by Qatar, \u2026).How do we fight in this new world? We have to learn to adapt. In other words: stop scrolling social media like zombies, bring a book and start reading and develop new skills (shields and swords). Fig. 2 Rise and decline empire source: Ray Dalio Note that: education is the first signal of decline, followed by competitiveness. \u201cIn effect, we know from Darwin that there are only four characteristics necessary in order to get adaptive evolution, right? If you have reproduction, variation, differential success, and an environment of limited resources, you\u2019re going to get adaptive evolution. When we set up an economic system, or a political system\u2026*it evolves*. Things evolve within it.\u201d Bret Weinstein, Biologist, PhD Why we fight? We fight because our planet has limited resources, and we need to use them efficiently, this is the only way to survive as human beings. We have to destroy what doesn\u2019t work anymore to build what will work better and efficiently. (E.g., renewable energy are going to destroy oil/gas, e-commerce vs brick and mortar, cryptocurrencies vs FIAT currencies, AI/blockchain/data are going to automatize bureaucracy and will free our species from the burden of bureaucracy/routine works in order to free our limited time and unleash our creativity.) Imagine a future world, with 30 billion people, where we will occupe thousands of surface meters to allocate gigantic off-line malls. Doesn\u2019t seem an efficient way to occupy the limited space of our planet, it seems better to have an efficient warehouse coordinated by robots with a virtual showcase ($AMZN) in a metaverse (SEHK700) where we can walk around thanks to virtual reality ($FB). That could permit free space for gigantic woods and parks in the real world. Maybe once there was a desert, now it was a forest. Maybe Thanks to a startup like Solar Water, where you have invested, that uses solar energy to power a desalination plant).Then stop complaining about the fact you are going to lose your job because of automation. You will lose it, it\u2019s unavoidable. Learn to adapt!Worry about an algorithm will substitute your work? Find the MOAT company, maybe a SaaS, save and invest in the company that develops this product, and gain from the future dividends and buybacks, buy it a fair price! (7. How the companies reward us). If you work well at the end you will retire from work and start doing whatever you want. Who will be the final opponent? Probably AI, I think automatization and algorithmes are going to push our species to the next level (or maybe singularity? Checkmate :P). Fig. 3 Chess champion Kasparov while he lose against Deep Blue \u201cAI ever allows us to truly understand ourselves, it will not be because these algorithms captured the mechanical essence of the human mind. It will be because they liberated us to forget about optimizations and to instead focus on what truly makes us human: loving and being loved.\u201d Kai-Fu Lee, PhD, Computer Science Mellon University (Guess who is strongly competing to develop the best AI infrastructure? China.) But for now, in order to evolve, is our responsibility (extinction is the alternative) to correctly allocate the limited resources available, thus we have to find a good Lord that will do this work for us.Indeed, the most important characteristic of a lord is exactly related to his ability in the capital allocation in order to expand the village, defend it, and make the best use of the available resources. Remember the notion of capital allocation, because we are going to talk about it in the next articles. Now the castle is named corporation and the lord is named CEO, but there is always a war to fight.As shareholders we are kings, and we need to preserve our wealth from the attacks of the enemies. Fig. 4 Economic moat source: getmoneyrich.com Why do I tell you this story? Because in next articles we are going to find the characteristics of a good castle and dig deeper about the qualities of a good lord, and how a good moat is built. Eventually the moat reassures us, if business has an advantage over the competitors, this advantage increases the reliability of our forecast about future cash generated by our company. Over the long run many competitors are going to try to take a piece of the pie (i.e., users, customers, revenue, cash flow). We need to defend our wealth.In the future we are going to talk also about, like a king, how much lands you need in order to increase your wealth (portfolio). \u201cEquity is the new land. Shareholder is the new landowner\u201d Naval Ravikant Economic MOAT In 1980 the academic Michael Porter wrote the book \u201cCompetitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors\u201d. In this book Porter described the five main forces which protect the profitability of a business. Fig. 5 Porter\u2019s 5 forces \u201cIncidentally, that\u2019s one of the things we look for in businesses; if you see a business take a lot of adversity and still do well, that tells you something about the underlying strength of the business\u2026 a way of evaluating the depth and impenetrability of the moat.\u201d Warren Buffett Financial moat gives us more certainty about future cash flow, reducing the intrinsic uncertainty of the humans\u2019 world. As you can see in figure 5 this moat could has various forms, in this blog we are going to dig the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of some of this moat Then when I will tell you about moat, you will know my purpose.During this blog we are going to develop a series of mental models that give us a better understanding of our world. Biology and evolution are two of these models, and history is another one. In the past, I had already written about psychology (8. Mr. Market). Those concepts mix together give us the basis of our mindset as investors for the long haul. \u201cDeveloping the habit of mastering the multiple models which underlie reality is the best thing you can do\u201d Charlie Munger (ELI5 mental models: a series of tools or ideas brought from the hard or soft science and applied to a complex argument, typically finance because of his complex and adaptive nature). Learn, train, take risks. In other words, fight! In this sense my blog\u2019s goal is to become your intellectual trainer and sparring partner. Following chapter 15.

US Security and exchange commission. \u201cThe SEC enforces the securities laws to protect the more than 66 million American households that have turned to the securities markets to invest in their futures\u2014whether it\u2019s starting a family, sending kids to college, saving for retirement, or attaining other financial goals.\u201d sec.gov As explained on the first page of the SEC website, the main goal of the capital market is to allow every household in the world to reach its financial goal. In this blog, we are going to learn how to do that the best way possible. Here we go! 10-K is the most important form, here we can find all the information we need about a company, a sector, an industry and also about the whole market. 10-K is even a broad informative document that educates us about a wide range of topics. We can learn how to invest, techniques to value companies, and not only that we are reading about. Unfortunately, 10-K exists only for US- based companies. For foreign companies quoted on the US market, there is the 20-F form, a variant similar to 10-K. The US is capitalism\u2019s homeland, therefore it\u2019s the best and advanced place to learn about the capital market. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to invest only in the US, but through the US forms, we can learn how to invest and how a company works, in a reliable way. The most reliable place to find 10k filings is the EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system), powered by the US government security and exchange commission. fig 2. EDGAR search engine In this digital environment, we have a lot of choice where we can find financial forms, but EDGAR is the main source of information, the only place that you can trust. Then, in the second place, but sometimes less reliable, is the Investor Relations page of the company itself. \u2026but what about 10-K. In the 10-K management talks about everything about the company, starting with detailed information about registered office addresses, the number of shares outstanding, the management discussions about: the company\u2019s future, the idiosyncratic and systemic risks, detail about management key people, current and future investments. You can also find detailed financial information and any current or past lawsuit. Learning to invest? 10-K helps you to understand the business but also tells you how the management defines the value of current and future investments, in quantitative and even in qualitative terms. Other than that, management discusses geopolitical topics. You can easily throw away the newspapers, what you need to know about our world, it is readable on the 10-K of a great company that operates worldwide. In other words, you are going to find the signal and what really counts. Understand the CEO In this document the CEO talks about the company, then you can understand what type of person is the person who administers your money, because this is the CEO work, decide how to invest your capital with the goal to earn the maximum return (capital allocation). There are some characteristics we can extrapolate from this filing about the CEO, for example, if s/he realizes the past promise and if s/he is honest and reliable about the company condition and future prospects. Obviously, you have to take her/his words with a grain of salt and skepticism, but is a good starting point to dig about her/his figure. The next step can be to go to youtube and view some interviews in order to give a face to the person we are going to give money to. The first time I read a 10-K form, I thought it drew a very grim figure of the company, that\u2019s good because it allowed us to take note of the risks. Investing is the art to face uncertainty and understand the risks and rewards of an investment decision, therefore a good management doesn\u2019t hide the negative aspects of the business. Remember: any investment decision involves risks, it is our job to understand risks and create a basket of companies that through a deep understanding and a bit of diversification allow us to reduce those risks. But what really matters is knowing the CEO and being sure about his honesty to convey all those risks. Competitors To understand the big picture, it is useful to also read competitors\u2019 10-k, this gives you the opportunity to better understand the sector and the risks. It\u2019s important to have a competitive advantage over the competitors to thrive, the 10-k tells you what competitors are doing and the difference between the economics of the companies in the same sector. Scuttlebutt Scuttlebutt is an investing tool proposed by the famous investor Phil Fisher in the book \u201cCommon stock and uncommon profits\u201d, this technique suggests a journalistic approach to investing. \u201cIt is amazing what an accurate picture of the relevant points of strength and weakness of each company in an industry can be obtained from a representative cross-section of the opinion of those who in one way or another are concerned with any particular company.\u201d Phil Fisher 10-K gives you the opportunity to extend your research far beyond the official source. Case point: I use google to do additional research while I dig into the filing of the company, for example: using google to search keywords or business stuff presented in the 10-K that we don\u2019t understand. Checking the Wikipedia page of the company, biography of the key persons (CEO, CEO, Board of directors). Personally, I check even the family situation of the CEO. Where has he worked in the past? Lawsuits? Fraud? Performance of the company where he had a key position?. Location of offices, factories, research institutes? Information about the audit company (big four: Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers) (ELI5: audit company reviews and validate the reliability of financials). There are a ton of sites that give us more insight (e.g. Glassdoor, Alexa rank, interbrand.com \u2026). It\u2019s important to be digitally smart and to use all the tools internet gives us to dig deeper. As I said, even watching a CEO interview on youtube is a good idea in order to better understand the key people of the company. As I explained in the past articles (10. Circle of competence), it\u2019s better to select a company in your circle of competence, this gives you an advantage in your ability to conduct a scuttlebutt approach, you can analyze the business first hand through your experience regards the products and you can speak with other stakeholders involved (e.g. others customers, in the case of Facebook you can pay attention to what people around you do with much of their free time, scrolling Instagram like without a meaning) Financial statements Obviously, in the 10-K we also fund more numerical data that we are going to dig in the next chapters. Ok, but it\u2019s long and boring. Do I really need to read all this stuff? Yes, you must do it. I suggest you make a habit of reading 10-K every day. Instead of reading the last useless news in the newspaper or random fake news on Facebook, read a 10-K. This will help you understand the world and become wealthy in the meantime. Remember: information is always distorted, your duty is to find the more reliable source and stick with it. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s easy to forget sometimes, a share is not a lottery ticket\u2026 it\u2019s part-ownership of a business.\u201d Peter Lynch Then we have to understand the business in order to buy a share. Finally a small piece of advice for all the beginner investors out there: don\u2019t waste too much time reading books, start as soon as possible reading financial stuff and especially a 10-K.

I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Fig 1. Naval Ravikant quote As usual, I want to start with a quote, in this case, Naval Ravikant, a notorious entrepeneur and angel Investor. For those uninformed about this branch of investing: Angel investors are the first investors in embryonic projects, namely start-ups. Naval is active on Twitter (@Naval) and, if you are interested, I warmly suggest you to follow his profile. Is bitcoin a speculation? Yes, it is, but why?Because cryptocurrencies don\u2019t generate Cash Flow. Is speculation a bad thing? It depends. In this term, even gold is speculation. However, I see a rationale behind cryptocurrencies, and I will explain my point of view. To objectively evaluate the feasibility of an investment (or speculation) we will use the long- term horizon lens. Indeed, we will eliminate the noise (example, hyper advertised method to become a billionaire with cryptocurrency xyz) and we\u2019re going to focus only on the signal. In other words, we\u2019re going to analyze why there would be a place for the crypto in a balanced portfolio. I\u2019ll suggest you to read my article about inflation first (Article 5.1 Appendix inflation). It\u2019s essential to understand inflation in order to give a sense to our reality.Cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin (BTC) suffered the classic bubble price evolution, in the past, even housewives speculated on Bitcoin.The result of this behavior, like almost every bubble, is that many people who believe they are getting rich, but in reality, they lose money. (Article Mr Market) Consequently, they have lost confidence in cryptocurrencies and even in the investing world. But being caught in a bubble is our fault, it doesn\u2019t mean that the underlying securities don\u2019t have value. Fig 2. BTC price chart Now, cryptocurrencies are bets, we don\u2019t know what the future holds for them. If we invest in a company that delivers products, we could expect that those products will still there in the future, and this dynamic will generate money for us as investors. In the case of cryptocurrencies, we can\u2019t apply the same reasoning.Cryptocurrencies are asymmetric bets (upside much greater than downside) against adverse macroeconomic events or simply bet on a digital revolution in the financial sector, a bet on an unorthodox and alternative future where central banks and governments lose control of inflation levers. What is a currency? A currency is a medium of exchange. What happens if that medium loses value? Simply, our savings lose value (inflation). What\u2019s the main difference between FIAT currency (e.g., USD, CHF, EUR, YEN, RNB, \u2026) and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is?The scarcity, in other words, Bitcoin is a finite resource like gold (21 million is the finite number of BTC). Indeed, historical, when there is a debasement of the currencies, people run to buy gold. Perhaps your anxiety about Bitcoin is the volatility of the price. Forget about volatility, you must reason over the long period where daily/monthly/yearly price action has no meaning. \u201cWhen an investor focuses on short-term investments, he or she is observing the variability of the portfolio, not the returns \u2013 in short, being fooled by randomness.\u201d Nassim N. Taleb In the short term, price fluctuations are random events, these are unpredictable.We have to think of risk/reward terms over the long run. I heard the crowd shouting about the instability of bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies. But what if volatility is only the first phase of the acquisition process? I mean, capitalization is low and there is a lot of uncertainty, but if step by step people will gain trust, volatility will decrease. Who will decide which will be the winner? Gold has value as a storage of value because we had decided so as a human collective. A long time ago, there were no more efficient ways to store value. \u201cIn this sense, it\u2019s more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value\u201d Satoshi Nakamoto 2009-02-18 The advantage of cryptocurrencies over gold is that: I don\u2019t need a vault to secure my wealth. Moreover, cryptocurrencies are divisible and transportable and in some cases cryptocurrencies allow smart contracts. (i.e., automatized contracts for Ethereum).Smart contracts can automatize financial processes and revolutionize the financial world as we know it. (Worried about your job? Get ready! Fintech is unavoidable). A smart contract can literally vaporize the financial and bureaucratic complexity of our times, allowing a plumber in Mumbai to make reliable contracts with his customers without being backed by the institutions. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are antifragile (Nassim Taleb \u2013 Antifragile, November 27, 2012), because every transaction is encrypted in a node, every computer involved in the blockchain holds a copy of the transactions ledger, then this ledger will survive until there is a copy of the ledger. Like a Hydra, you can cut one head, but another head will pop. Fig.3 Antifragility What are governments going to do? Actually, nobody knows. At the moment various governments around the world are working on their own cryptocurrencies, the most advanced in this field is the PRC (People\u2019s of China) with its DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment). Then is it possible they will try to repress decentralized cryptocurrencies?(ELI5: decentralized cryptocurrencies are cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin that aren\u2019t controlled by any entity but conversely are distributed worldwide through all the computers involved in the blockchain (ledger that records digital transactions). Yes, it is possible, and, it has already been done. But Bitcoin seems antifragile, in other words, the fact that it is decentralized makes it difficult to prevent Bitcoin from spreading, mostly in countries that are experiencing inflation right now.To date, since the start of the pandemic, the Federal reserve US printed 3 trillion USD, and other western countries are doing the same. Fig. 4 Money \u201cprinting\u201d, Swiss National Bank (SNB) wins the prize for the best printing machine \u201cBRRRRRRRR\u201d Inflation doesn\u2019t only depend on money growth but is the relation between circulating money and velocity of money (ELI5 velocity of money equals the number of times an average dollar is used to buy goods and services in a given time unit).When an economic machine shut down, as in the case of covid pandemic lockdowns, the velocity of money decreases, we will see what will happen when the system restarts to cruise speed.Inflation is a strange beast even for economists. \u201cI think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that\u2019s missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without A knowing B or B knowing A.\u201d Milton Friedman, Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 1999. I want you to remember that giving financial advice is not my role. I only want to share my thoughts about what I read and consequently what I think about financial topics. I have deliberately reduced the information in order to distill what I think is notable about this topic.In the end, Bitcoin is a bet, a bet on a financial revolution that, in my opinion, has to start. Disclosure: Bitcoin has been part of my portfolio for two years (2%), the rest is invested in earnings assets and cash. If you decide to put money in cryptocurrencies, expect turbulences in price. The goal of the blog isn\u2019t speculation. Anyhow, I prefer to remain open- minded and to analyze other opportunities. This is indispensable and required to develop correct mental models about our world. Suppose you are new to my blog and you don\u2019t understand investing basics. In that case, I discourage you to speculate, and I suggest you to follow my main topic: a series of articles where I try to explain the basics of investing in solid businesses.

Berkshire Hathaway $BRK Do you remember when I spoke about how companies reward us? (7. How the companies reward us). I decided to write some case studies in the course of this blog because I think that reinforces the concepts in our minds. Initially, the goal of those studies is to explore events that give us a hint about a particular notion, analyzed during the main course. In the future, I will write a whole analysis of stocks that are under my radar or in my portfolio. In this case, I\u2019ll refer to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s share repurchase in the last quarter. Berkshire Hathaway $BRK is the company whose chairman is the known Warren Buffett. $BRK is a holding, in other words, it\u2019s a company that owns other companies. The work of Buffett as chairman and Munger as vice-chairman is to allocate the capital generated by the holding towards subsidiaries and sometimes acquiring whole private companies or slices of businesses in the stock market. Fig.2 Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries Buffett\u2019s skill is to find the best way to allocate the money towards his business with the goal to generate high returns for shareholders of $BRK and for himself, since he has a good portion of his wealth in $BRK. Here another lesson to take, a good manager has skin in the game, it means he\u2019s involved in the risks beared by the shareholders. \u201cIf you do not take risks for your opinion, you\u2019re nothing.\u201d Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life Sometimes the best idea is just to invest in his stocks. Buffett careful does buybacks only when the price of $BRK is below its intrinsic value (Intrinsic value: notion we just started to learn in the blog but about we will go deeper in the future, ELI5 Intrinsic value or fair value is the price you should pay for a company from a business perspective, in respect of its future earnings). Well, what happened in the last quarter? Berkshire decided to repurchase its own shares for an amount of 9 Billion dollars, already in the previous quarter, Buffett repurchased 5.1 Billion. Since the start of the Covid-19 crisis that crashed the market, Buffett gave to $BRK shareholders a total of 14.1 Billion. I have to say that I\u2019m a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and this decision make me happy for two reasons: 1) Buffett felt that BRK was undervalued, this means that I bought BRK at a fair price. Basically, my evaluation was right from Buffett\u2019s perspective. 2) The price of BRK rises propelled by share repurchase, therefore my wealth grows. Fig 3. Second buyback period. An important lesson we can extrapolate from this event: A good company uses his money to invest in his own business when Mr Market (8. Mr Market) throws good prices. But the most important point is the balance sheet of the company. In other words a lot of cash and low debt, in this way, when the crisis comes, management can take the opportunities that arise from. \u201cIn the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity\u201d Sun Tzu Not every management repurchases shares in the best moment, often managers repurchase shares when the price is very high. In periods of widespread optimism, many managers in order to please shareholders and to exercise their options (Management stock options: we will return on this point, ELI5: benefits to management if stocks reach a certain price) they do buybacks in the worst period, when the stock price is overvalued. Fig.3 Boeing ($BA) shares rep and debt pile Fig.4 Boeing ($BA) stock price Those two images are enough to explain what goes wrong with Boeing. Managers repurchase shares when the price was high, moreover, they do buybacks while piling a lot of debt, instead of doing that with cash produced by the business itself (Free cash flow). I\u2019ll remind a notion that I have already explained in a previous article: if managers repurchases shares when the price is high, they reduce the total ownership less than if they do buybacks when the price is low. When the prices are low, with the same amount of money management can buy more shares. Therefore, fewer shares outstanding implies more value for us as shareholders. \u201cWhat is smart at one price is stupid at another\u2019.\u201d Warren Buffett In the end, I want to point out the difference between investing and speculating. Speculators buy stocks waiting for another buyer who pays more and they gain thanks to the difference, an investor instead buys a business and his gain depends on the quality of the management and the cash generated by the business itself. The former hopes to find a buyer, sometimes only more fools than him. The latter invests in the business for the long run and gains because of the business itself not for the willingness of other speculators to pay more for the same piece of paper.

Disney (DIS) 1951 annual report Well, let\u2019s start our journey through the numbers. As I said, quantitative analysis isn\u2019t my preferred part. I prefer good stories, but over time, due to some errors, I understood the importance of numbers. Stories sometimes lie (i.e because the CEOs lie, often they are only good salesmen. We will learn how to value a good CEO). Even numbers sometimes lie (Financial shenanigans), but if we learn how to read a financial statement, we reduce the odds of errors.Moreover, if we want to define the value of a company, we have to account for actual numbers and projections of their future. Those projections will be defined by a story, preferably good stories. The results of our calculations will be a fair value. In other words, the number (i.e. price) we are willing to pay for a given stock.Remember: we want to mix numbers with stories in a balanced manner. (Article 11. stories and numbers). \u201cAccounting is the language of business\u201d Warren Buffett The company\u2019s financial documents are usually available in the investor relations part of the official website.For example, you can see the Facebook investor platform: https://investor.fb.com/home/default.aspx Fig 2. Income statement fiscal year 2019 Facebook (FB) Another option is to use a web platform like Yahoo Finance, QuickFS, TIKR, or so on.Those platforms show the same data of financial statements plus a series of useful tools, e.g. ratios. I will write about ratios in a specific article.Personally, I prefer to use those platform because at glance I can see all the numbers I need. Moreover these platforms allow us to have a chart representation that simplifies the analysis. Fig 3. Data chart representation source TIKR.com Annual report. One of the most important document is the annual report. Here we can find the most part of the data we need. Numbers are shown through tables where the company put the financial results of the current year compared with the past years.The three main financial statements we can find are: income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.Noting that those three statements are also available on a quadrimestral basis, in this report is also possible to find the guidance. Guidance is the projection of the future numbers of the company, provided by the management for the successive quarter. Form 10-K. 10-K is another form filled annually by the company. 10-K is more detailed than the annual report.As well as numbers, the 10-K form contains qualitative data about the prospect of the company, management discussion, and the risks related to the business model, all of this is useful to create our story about the company and define the future profitability.Changes in business happen over years, it doesn\u2019t happen over days, or weeks, or even months, so usually it\u2019s useless to check every quarter in detail. In the next articles, I will dig deeper into income statements and the numbers we have to focus on. Following chapter 13. 10-k Feel free to comment, share my article with friends and subscribe to my newsletter if you like my content and you want to follow me towards financial freedom.

In other words, if you invest like Lynch, with a starting capital of 20\u2019000 USD, you end the 13 years with 560\u2019000 USD. If you are like me, you would be excited about this massive return. Anyway, if we analyze the quote, we can understand a fundamental concept about investing: it is not all about numbers. Numbers. Fig 1. Formulas If we think about finance, we are maybe forced to believe that it was a mere question of puzzling numbers, greek letters, or mathematics formulas. \u201cRead Ben Graham and Phil Fisher read annual reports, but don\u2019t do equations with Greek letters in them.\u201d Warren Buffett Numbers are an essential fact in the investment world, numbers tell us many things about the cash inflow and outflow of the money, but we don\u2019t need complicated formulas. We only need basic concepts of accounting.In the finance world, this part of the analysis is called \u201cQuantitative\u201d. For quantitative analysis, we need the financial statements numbers, readable in the quarterly issue form produced by the company. It\u2019s unnecessary to read the results of every quarter, but suffice to read the statements at the end of the fiscal year. We are looking for increasing revenue, a strong balance sheet and high margins, and we are looking for a management that is able to reinvest our money in the best way possible. Remember: we want to invest in a small number of businesses in the long run, then we have to understand how those businesses work. Stories Numbers aren\u2019t enough. I\u2019ve to confess to you that I don\u2019t like math, I prefer stories. Indeed, this is my favorite part of investing. The main goal of qualitative analysis (stories) is to understand the business\u2019s side that it can\u2019t be quantified in numbers terms. For example, understand how the persons behind the decision are, make an inquiry about the CEO. Who is? From where s/he came from? What did s/he do in the past? Did s/he grow in the firm culture or s/he is external to the company? Moreover, we want to know the goal of the firms and the culture inside the firms. Culture defines the value within the company. Consequently, the value and the attachment of the employers to the firm, happy and determined employers give a strong background to the firm, attract new and qualified people who want to work in the company. But even more important is the satisfaction of the customers who can be our friends, our parents or maybe ourselves. We don\u2019t have to go far to find some answers.But what we want to know above all is: what is the competitive advantage of the company? This part will be subject to future articles, because the competitive advantage is a crucial point, and it lies in the most part in the narrative side of the analysis. A competitive advantage allows the firm to survive and become stronger over time. Warren Buffett defined the competitive advantage of a company as the moat of a castle, a series of intrinsic attributes of a business that defend it by the outside attacks from other businesses that want to gain our customers and our market share, for example, Pepsi Vs. Coca Cola, Apple Vs. Samsung, and so on. Fig.2 Moat Investing is a craft. Only if we can mix those two parts together, then we will come up with a complete thesis that will compel us to invest in a specific business for the years to come. To do that there isn\u2019t a mathematics formula that gives certainty to our decision. Fig 3. Craft Academics tried hard to find a mathematical solution to harness investing, but precisely because investing is an art, this is an impossible task.It would be far simpler to reduce investing in mathematical formulas and tell those formulas to the students in academia. \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler\u201d Albert Einstein Why is it impossible to reduce the investing world only in a series of formulas? Simply because finance is a complex adaptive system dominated by the human component that it is always uncertain. In this field, because of the human component, there is a lot of psychology and philosophy. This, will be part of my blog.In the next article I will write about the interpretation of financial statements. Stay tuned! Following chapter 12.

One of the most essential things in investing is to develop a circle of competence. What does it mean? The investing world is so vast and sometimes complex (often because Wall Street wants to make it look so, together we learn not to be afraid), the better way to master the game is to start by defining our boundaries. Fig 1. Wall Street Choose your battlefield! There are a lot of financial instruments which it is possible to put our money. This blog is already limited to earning assets (ELI5 \u2013 investments that deliver stable returns) tied to real business, namely stocks. Other opportunities in the field of investing are real estate, real estate investment trusts (REITs), bonds, derivative instruments (e.g.stock options), commodities (like gold), currencies (USD, CHF,..), cryptocurrency (I know a lot of you waited this moment :D) and so on. If you want to dig about those other opportunities, I invite you to do your research, in other words: Ask Google. In my opinion, some of the instruments I cited aren\u2019t investments but rather speculations. So why did I choose stocks? Simply because products of entrepreneur decisions are often things that we need, and sometimes we use. It is simpler for me to understand those things. Some products are simply needful, then it\u2019s likely they deliver returns over the long run. Do you remember? I\u2019m looking for investment opportunities to grow my wealth in the long haul (article 6. The eighth marvel of the world). Think about Coke, Gillette, McDonald\u2019s, Walmart. Moreover, I like to be part of a project, in other words, to be the owner of a business. Understand yourself and make it fun. There are other steps to defining our field of competence. That can be fun, because, as said by Li Lu, we have to understand what we like. A good starting point can be our work. You will make history. Whatever your choice, like owners, you will participate in the development of new projects and products. Personally, in this Digital Age, I find this opportunity stimulating. The stock market is like a gigantic crowdfunding system where democratically, you will decide what project you want to finance and what project to be part of. But don\u2019t get caught by the hottest topic of the moment, I mentioned the Digital Age, but there are other industries around. You have to pick your personal niche. It\u2019s possible that because of your job, you have a specific niche yet. If you are a fireman, maybe you use a specific tool regularly. If you use firsthand this tool and you know it works well it\u2019s a good starting point. Perhaps you even know that firefighters of other countries use the same product or maybe the entire range of products of this specific company, and this company is well known by the fire departments of the whole nation for the quality of its products. Well, congratulations, you have a circle of competence. Or perhaps you are an employee that uses a specific software, or a housewife who uses a specific tool to do housework, the same idea is applicable to all the professions, hobbies or entertainments.Then you must learn about the business behind it.I promise you, we will learn this throughout this blog. Be part of a business for the long haul. This is the beauty of capitalism, be part of what we use or of what we like. I want to share an example with you about this point. Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, owes some of his fortunes to Coke (KO). He invests a lot of money in it, and he becomes rich even thanks to this soft drink brand. The interesting side of this story is that he started his love story with the brand when he was young. When he was a child he collected a refund from recycled Coke bottles. Over time he never lost his passion about the brand. He bought his first share in 1988. Then he never sold, instead he bought more over time, when Mr. Market (article 8. Mr. Market) gives him opportunities to buy at a low price. \u201cOf a certainty, it was in 1936 that I started buying Cokes at the rate of six for 25 cents from Buffett & Son, the family grocery store, to sell around the neighborhood for 5 cents each. In this excursion into high-margin retailing, I duly observed the extraordinary consumer attractiveness and commercial possibilities of the product. I continued to note these qualities for the next 52 years as Coke blanketed the world. Only in the summer of 1988 did my brain finally establish contact with my eyes\u2026What was already the world\u2019s most ubiquitous product gained new momentum, with sales overseas virtually exploding. Of course, we should have started buying Coke much earlier, soon after Roberto and Don began running things. In fact, if I had been thinking straight, I would have persuaded my grandfather to sell the grocery store back in 1936 and put all of the proceeds into Coca-Cola stock. I\u2019ve learned my lesson: My response time to the next glaringly attractive idea will be slashed to well under 50 years.\u201d Warren Buffett \u2013 1989 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders letter. Fig 2. Coca Cola (KO) trend over the last 40 years As you can see, the trend of Coke (KO) over time remains positive. Moreover, the company rewards him with a growing dividend (article 7. How companies reward us). Sometimes the best ideas are under our eyes. For example, thanks to a friend of mine, I recently discovered that Facebook created a specific tool used by a company he worked for (Workplace by Facebook). This type of information is very insightful when it comes to analyzing a business.But remember: \u201cBuying stocks without studying the companies is the same as playing poker \u2014 and never looking at your cards.\u201d Peter Lynch In the next article, I will dig deeper into this point. Stay tuned. Following chapter 11.

Tesla (TSLA) Logo In the eighth article (8. Mr Market), I wrote about Tesla (TSLA) and its high quotation in relation to other carmakers. In my series of articles I haven\u2019t touched the fundamental analysis basis.Anyway, Tesla gives me the chance to highlight some points and concepts. Fig 2. Tesla (TSLA) price chart 2020. As you can read in the \u201cMr. Market\u201d article, sometimes the agents that make up the market follow an irrational behavior.Tesla (TSLA) for example in one week lost over 30% of its market value. While in the last six months, the market value has grown by 700%. Be Rational! We have to be careful, here isn\u2019t a rational attitude behind those movements. Moreover, these movements are so fast and violent.When people invest and follow the momentum caused by the herd instead of a rational cognitive process, the risk of losing our mind is high.When the price goes up the classic thought is: \u201cI\u2019m missing the chance of my life to become rich, buy a boat and have a Bilzerian\u2019s lifestyle\u201d. That is called FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).When a stock goes down the thought could be: \u201cOMG I will lose all my money and I will have to go live under a bridge\u201d.It is scientifically proven that money loss hurts more than happiness follows a profit (Source: PhD Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences), moreover, a money loss stimulates the brain side that processes the physical pain (source: Hidehiko Takagashi \u2013 Kyoto University). It\u2019 time to evolve. Remember: we are a species of evolved human beings namely Value Investors, our decisions are based on data processing, not animal instincts.I leave you with the first tool of fundamental analysis, which is one of the most known metrics in the financial world and it is the Price to earnings ratio (P/E).I must specify that P/E is only one of the metrics used in finance but in this context, it\u2019s worth writing about it.The equation behind P/E is simply Price divided by Earnings.Price is the market quotation while earnings are the net income of the company. You can use the total market capitalization (share price*number of share outstanding) divided by total earnings (most publicized company\u2019s data), or simply by divided share price for earnings per share (EPS).You can find this data on finance.yahoo.com, usually, P/E is already calculated and shows as one of the first data.Metrics and ratios are used in the field of a relative quotation, namely allowing you to compare at a glance various companies in the same industry or to compare the same company over time.With this first simple metric, you can do for yourself an incomplete evalutation of Tesla (TSLA). Fig. 3 P/E Tesla (TSLA) source: google.com Fig 4. P/E Toyota (TM) But don\u2019t fool yourself, a real business evaluation is more complicated.Someone can argue that Tesla is a different kind of automaker because we have to expect more growth in various sectors tied to renewable energy, energy storage, self-driving car, robotaxi, and so on. But, even it\u2019s true, be careful when the price of a company is tied more (or even just) to the future than to the present, mostly when you pay a price 1000 times the earnings.The future is always uncertain. Remember: \u201cPrice is what you pay; value is what you get.\u201d Warren Buffett This doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have to invest in Tesla.My goal isn\u2019t to give financial advice, only to share my thoughts.

Life, economy, business. The economy follows a cyclical pattern, the same is true for human life and business life but we will dig deeper into business life when we will talk about valuation. Economic cycles are mainly defined by the relation between credits and debts. The best explanation on this matter was published by Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Hedge Fund.If you want a more comprehensive description I invite you to watch his video lesson on youtube How the economic machine works.I think is important to understand the basics of how the economic machine works in order to be a good investor. Time Value. Basically a debt is an agreement between two parts that money given today (principal) will be repaid in the future with a premium (interest). It\u2019s obvious that if I give you a sum of money I expect to be paid for the time that my money is in your hand.In other words, with this money I can do various things that give me a return, then if I decide to give you this money, I lose the opportunity to invest in other things that could have a return. This is called the time value of money and it is one of the most fundamental notions in finance. The power of debt. Meanwhile, you have my money, you can use this money to generate a profit greater than the interests you will pay to me. Typically banks are the main lenders in our system but individuals, too. They can lend money to other individuals (households debt) or corporations (corporate bonds). Government and state also are in debt. The principle doesn\u2019t change.All those entities ideally borrow money with the goal to create more wealth in the future in order to repay the principal plus interest and make the gain. The best example to describe those dynamics is a simple business like a farm. Imagine that a farmer has already a land, paid with his own money. Now he wants to sow wheat but he doesn\u2019t have a tractor, the farmer has 2 choices: saving for months until he can buy the tractor or take a loan and buying the tractor now, this means earn already now. An obvious part of future gains will be utilized to repay the principal and to pay interest, but if he does the math he can earn more and he will develop his business.I have deliberately left out debts related to private consumption like a new TV, new car, new tablet because is not a matter of this blog and I think is a stupid use of this instrument.Instead of getting into debt to buy useless stuff, learn the art of saving. \u201cDo not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving.\u201d Warren Buffett This mechanism creates the economic cycle, the time where we get into debts and we grow and time where we have to pay back this debt then our spending capacity decreases. When we get into debt, usually because central banks adopt expansionary policies, productivity explodes boosted by low-interest rates. Fig 1. Debt cyclization \u2013 source Economic Principles Long term horizon. This can\u2019t last forever then there will be the reverse process. However, in a healthy economy, the productivity line will grow in the long term. Fig 2. Economic cycle source: Ray Dalio This is an extreme synthesis that gives you a broad idea about the whole credits-debts economy. \u201cI spend about fifteen minutes a year on economic analysis.\u201d\u201d Peter Lynch Following the suggestion of Peter Lynch, I think the argument doesn\u2019t worth more time.For a more comprehensive explanation, I refer you to the clip realized by Ray Dalio.

Article by Warren Buffett promoting value investing, published in the Fall, 1984 issue of Hermes, Columbia Business School magazine. I\u2019ve a confession to say: I\u2019m a Value Investor or at least is what I aim to be.I\u2019m sure a lot of you are wondering about what means to be a Value Investor.To be a Value Investor is counterintuitive because it isn\u2019t in the nature of human beings to behave like a Value Investor.It\u2019s precisely for that reason that it is the right path to follow. Do you remember? In the last article (8. Mr. Market) I spoke about the contrarian attitude of a good investor.It\u2019s very hard to be a contrarian because humans like animals are subjected to herd bias. Why is it so hard to be a contrarian? Because animals in the middle of the herd tend to behave like the other members of the herd, mostly when there is an upcoming threat and little time to think what to do.Under pressure and in the middle of uncertainty we will follow the herd because we believe it\u2019s safer to stay with the crowd. I would say that most of the time this is true, but sometimes the herd reacts in an emotional way through a self-reinforced pattern, because every member follows the next fellow and that generates a chain reaction (bubble, in the case of the stock market. Remember GoPro chart?)Today is a hard time for value investors. With a lot of money flooded in the system, whenever you put your money you will see your capital gain, but untilwhen? Remember, the economy follows cycles, and the winner it\u2019s who is willing to stick with a different path for the long term, it\u2019s who will cope with the entire cycle. Fig 2. Economic Cycles source: Ray Dalio \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked.\u201d Warren Buffett How can we navigate the financial sea in any weather?Simple enough, we must be value investors and behave like a business owner. Like a good captain, we have to choose a great boat with a powerful engine, energy efficiency, and without holes in the shell. But because we don\u2019t have infinite capital, we have to buy at the right price!What does it mean to be a value investor? Or what is value investing?.In the past article I broadly defined the concept when I spoke about the importance of thinking about yourself as a business owner, then like a business owner what it\u2019s important for you are the business performances not what price Mr. Market offers you for your business.As usual, I sum up the question with a quote: \u201cAll intelligent investing is value investing, acquiring more than you are paying for. You must value the business in order to value the stock.\u201d Charlie Munger Over time what counts about a business isn\u2019t the emotional attitude of Mr. Market or the economic cycle. What really matters is how much money the business makes in order to grow, repurchase its own stocks or pay a dividend, the price follows the right path in the long haul. Fig 3. Red line \u2013 stable fundamental growth vs black line \u2013 Mr. Market irrational quotations. I want to highlight two aspects of the value investor attitude: Contarian attitude Patience It requires patience because it can takes time for the market to recognize the value of a company conversely it can takes times for Mr Market to offers you a good business at an interesting price. The father of Value Investing once said: \u201cThe stock investor is neither right or wrong because others agreed or disagreed with him; he is right because his facts and analysis are right.\u201d Benjamin Graham While is the best student added: \u201cThe stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\u201d Warren Buffett In the next article, I will introduce the concept of fundamentals analysis.

Mr Market So far I concentrate my contents on the business and the importance of a good management, now we have to speak about the market price.The stock market is auction based. Roughly speaking; agents that compose the market (institutional investors like pension funds or retail investors like us) offer a price for any security exchanged (for example stocks) on the market.The price depends on the money that any agent is willing to pay to another agent for a given stock (company\u2019s ownership) i.e law of supply and demand.Said that, it is obvious that inside this market there is a lot of human nature, in other words: emotions.Fear, greed, envy, pride, self-esteem are components of human nature that characterise the market auction based dynamics.At this point the situation becomes complicated, because the market can be seen as if it were a person itself, namely Mr Market.The best explanation was stated by Benjamin Graham, father of Value Investing, and revisited by Warren Buffett. \u201cMr. Market is kind of a drunken psycho. Some days he gets very enthused, some days he gets very depressed. And when he gets really enthused you sell to him, and if he gets depressed, you buy from him. There\u2019s no moral taint attached to that.\u201d Warren Buffett For better explain this point I would show you a chart. Fig 2. Tesla (TSLA) stock chart 2019-2020 As you can see, Tesla stock more than quadruples its value in less than 6 months, anyway the fundamentals financial valuation metrics don\u2019t fluctuate in the same way over the short-term. A simple example is the market value of Tesla. At the moment Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is double than Toyota even if Tesla sells an infinitesimal number of cars compared to Toyota.Clearly that isn\u2019t a sufficient analysis, anyway is better to be careful about the stock price skyrocketing.Conversely in the long run, fundamental data of the business and the price we will eventually converge.For that reason you don\u2019t have to focus on the short term fluctuation, if not to take advantage on the discounted price. Your wealth will generate over the long term.What causes that short term fluctuations? As I said early, the stock market has an emotional reaction to any short term news that click bait media throws us.The modern world is full of news, data and information, this because there is always someone making a living thanks to your click on the last news s/he writes.The secret is to concentrate on fundamentals data and not on the latest news on CNBC network, and that\u2019s the goal of my blog.But if you are enthused about Tesla\u2019s chart, I will show another chart that shows you what happens when emotion takes place of rationality. Fig 3. GoPro (GPRO) price chart I can\u2019t predict the future of Tesla. Anyway as you can see, when Mr Market changes its mood, you might lose a good part of your capital. I\u2019ve to quote again the best investor of all time, Warren Buffett: \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d Warren Buffett In other words, if you want to be a good investor you have to be a contrarian. Above all, you have to make decisions based on the facts and not on the emotions, and stock price sometimes represents this collective emotion response. \u201cI\u2019m not emotional about investments. Investing is something where you have to be purely rational and not let emotion affect your decision making \u2013 just the facts.\u201d Bill Ackman \u2013 Pershing Square Capital Remember: any time you buy a stock, somebody sell you this stock. You have to ask yourself: \u201cWhy I think I\u2019m in the right side of the transaction?\u201d Remember that on the other side there will be a professional investor with an IQ of 140, an AI algorithm or even Warren Buffett.In the continuation of my blog, I will explain how to value a business and what kind of traps to avoid during the path.

As I explained in the preceding chapters, businesses use the stock market to finance their activities.Basically there are two ways that companies use for financing themselves: debt and equity.My blog focuses on equity holders or also called shareholders.As shareholders we own a piece of business, while debt holders (bondholders) finance the companies through credits.Usually bondholders, because they are not owners, they are the first allowed to claim their money if the company goes bankrupt. There is a sort of hierarchy of claim where the shareholders are the last allowed to claim their part of the company\u2019s wealth after default.This mechanic put the shareholders in a risky position but even gives us the probability of a better gain.Bondholder return is given and limited while return for shareholders is potentially unlimited.But don\u2019t worry, that risk can be managed and I will explain to you how to do it in future articles.Our objective is to find good companies that pay us back as much as possible.This idea is called \u201cCapital allocation\u201d. Namely find where to put money in order to obtain the maximum return on capital. Returns are essentially divided in 3 main ways: Dividends Buybacks Retained earnings Dividends The most simple and direct method that companies use to share their profits with investors. Dividends are a percentage of the total amount of the capital invested that is pay back monthly or yearly.For example Coke Company pays a dividend of 1.64 USD for every share that in this moment worth approximately 46 USD per share (08 august 2020), this dividend is 3.4% of the total capital you had invested in. Usually this dividend is destined to grow over time. Fig 2. Coke dividend growth Buybacks Another option to share profit is through stocks buybacks.Company buys its own shares in order to reduce the number of circulating shares, doing so investors gain thanks to the rise in percentage owned by the company.For example: if I had a company that was worth 100b and I divided this company into 100 pieces (stocks), every investor owns 1/100 of the company and therefore 1/100 of the profit. But what happens if I remove 10 pieces of this company shares? Now the remaining investors own 1/90 of the company or in other words a bigger piece of the pie.A good management buys back stocks when the market price is below the intrinsic value. What is intrinsic value? I will explain in future articles. Summing up, intrinsic value or fair value, it is the value of the firm based on its intrinsic characteristics. Like the value of a car is based on the horsepower or on the brand\u2019s value.Remember: the value of a company IS NOT the market price.The price is only what the other investors are willing to pay for receiving the ownership of the business. Last but not least point is: Retained earnings Companies keep profit for a lot of tasks.It seems silly that the company doesn\u2019t pay their earnings to us.In reality it is the best option but only if we trust in management competence.If management has good ideas and it knows how to use your money to grow the business, you will gain thanks to organic growth of the business itself (development of a new product) or through smart acquisition (for example when FB acquired Instagram). That growth will increase the pie size and then the value of your ownership, that it will recognised by the market in the future, in others words the stock price will increase. Fig 3. Brands acquisited by Disney thanks to smart capital allocation Another example: Disney is expanding its brand territories by developing a platform, Disney+, to cope with the competitors, and follow the changing users behaviors, from purchasing DVDs to buying streaming services.

He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn\u2019t, pays it.\u201d Attributed to Albert Einstein The concept behind the compound interest is very simple.Imagine you have a bank account that earn you an annual interest of 4% (it is an utopias today), if you put 1000USD in your bank account the 1 january of the year, at the end of the year your account gain is 40USD (1000*0.04), hence you will start the new year with 1040USD on your account. If the next year the bank will give you another 4% interest rate and you don\u2019t withdraw money at the end of the year, you will end with the initial amount of 1040USD plus interest, but this time the interest would be 4% of 1040USD that will be 41.6USD for a total of 1081.6 in year two.This pattern will be followed for the following years and it will become exponential. Below you can see the result after 30 years of compounding for only 1000USD at 4% yearly without further deposits. Fig 1. Compound interest 1000usd 30 years later at 4% You can test the potential of this concept through the link below: Compound interest calculator US gov As investors this becomes relevant, because our goal is to find businesses that compound their capital, consequently our wealth far above 4%.Personally I look for companies that compound 15%+. Fig. 2 Compound interest 1000USD 20 years at 15% If we will find and we will stick with companies that have such marvel we will do well in the long run.Obviously is matter of time and patience, citing the great investor of all time: \u201cThe stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\u201d Warren Buffett In the next article I will write about different ways used by companies to pay us back as investors.

If there is a lot more money, this money loses value. Fig 1. US Dollars debasement What does it mean for those who don\u2019t invest? It means that the value of their bank account decreases over time.Today interests on bank accounts are very low, much less than the inflation that affects your currency.Another reason to invest even just in an Index fund, like I spoke in the last article.

What is the difference? Stock market is composed by many companies that produce a broad range of products and services. These companies together make the basement of the country productivity.Because the world follows a growing path in terms of circulating money, number of citizens and consequently numbers of products and services, if we add up the value of all the national company or from a specific sector, and we buy a piece of that collection, over time we will gain thanks to the growth of the worldwide Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Fig. 1 source Federal Reserve As you can see in the US the circulating money is growing and that money goes into the pockets of those who invest. For example, I often heard people complaining about riches. The difference between poor and rich is that the riches take assets through the investing practice, while poors take liabilities because they spend all their income for short-term futile purpose. With passive investing method you can buy through a fund a piece of a sector, a country or even the entire world and partecipate in the wealth growing. An example is S&P500. Fig. 2 source Wikipedia This is a bouquet of the 500 largest US companies, in finance this instrument is called \u201can index\u201d, specifically in this case is called Index Fund. For the 10 years ending December 31st 2019, had an annual compounded rate of return of 13.2%, including reinvestment of dividends. Fig. 3 Compound interest on last 10 years of S&P500 on a initial investment of 10000 USD to 34000 USD As you can see in the long run the growth of the Index follows the path of the growth of the circulating money. S&P500 is only an example, there is plenty of index for every nation or sector. Exchange Traded Fund Today we have specific financial instruments that mimic the trend of the various indexes. This instrument is called Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). ETFs are exchange like stocks and the main issuer of this instrument are Vanguard or iShare.An example is SPY, if you have a bank account you can ask your consultant about this option. Fig 4 Main components of S&P500 (SPY) Source Yahoo finance If you follow this path, you don\u2019t have to worry about the soundness of a single company where you invest, because you invest in the entire market. Market is tied to the continuous growth of the economic world, propelled by injection of money by central banks. Fig 5. Returns by Asset Class (1996-2015) source J.P. Morgan As you can see the best choice for the average Joe is to put their savings on a S&P 500 fund.REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) is another financials istrument that I will talk about in the future. Stock picking The second way is the path that I have decided to follow.I never liked to go to the restaurant and order the menu, I prefer choose by myself without intromissions.Furthermore you can earn more money but there is more work to do.For that reason, pick stock will be the main theme of this blog.

Fig1. Disney historical stock price It\u2019s simply a matter of time and patience.When this guy\u2019s grandparents bought Disney\u2019s stocks, it was obvious that Disney was a great company to invest in. This is only one of a lot of goals that one person can have. Do you finally know what\u2019s my goal?Well, my goal is freedom. What do I mean? I mean buyback my time and live my life how I want.Impossible? No.Simple? Obviously not. How is this possible? I will explain you in the next article. Following chapter 5.

We can\u2019t wait for nothing, though it is empirically established that success depends on the willingness to delay gratification. This concept is the base of investing.Citing the wealth investor ever: \u201cThe stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\u201d Warren Buffett This is the way to make money in the stock market, and as I told in the last article: is the way to improve our society .Nevertheless a good portion of the people in the stock market, are emotion seekers, they enter the market with the wrong mindset thereby they lose money.They trade stocks like pieces of paper without considering that behind the numbers presented on the scoreboard every seconds (quotations) there\u2019s a firm with employees and employers, with plants and buildings, with products and ideas.These above make up the true value of a stock. For that reason we have to analyse the fundamental components of a business and then invest in what these firms produce in the future. When we buy stock we buy a piece of all the tangible components and the ideas of a business. When we buy stocks, we buy a piece of the society, we invest to improve the future of our society and the future of our wealth. Following chapter 3.

However I think that the best starting point is questioning yourself about the motivation based on the choice to invest.Personally I think that society give us tools to better interact with reality, it\u2019s our responsibility to acknowledge about this tools and learn how to use it. Fig. Coke - Iconic symbol of capitalism Investing is one of these tools, precisely is the fundamental tool that our society uses to evolve.The main goal of investing is to correctly allocate capital in the world, give the money to people who can make the best use of it.With this money people can build the foundations of our society, this foundations are called firm, corporations, business project. If the people that lead this project succeed to make best use of our money, in the long run, he/she and we, we can participate in the evolution and will be repaid with the growth of our capital.What does that mean for society? Growth of knowledge, new jobs and wealth for all the citizens, plus we can enjoy new products and innovation.We are the engine of evolution and money is the fuel. \u201cOverall capitalism [meaning free markets] is intrinsic to the human species.

The first thing to do is recovering the financial statements of the company that we have chosen. A good idea is to choose a company within our circle of competence (10. Circle of competence). What we are going to learn: Read an income statement at a glance Focus on the fundamental numbers Extrapolate some metrics Contextualizing the numbers Email Address The goal is to find the best compounder with a competitive advantage. As in the previous article, I will take, again, Facebook (FB) as an example. The first thing to do is to go on Google and digitize \u201cFB investor relations\u201d. Once we are in the investor page we have to open the last earnings release and search for the Statements of Income. Like I explained in the preceding article (12. Starting Point), there are plenty of platforms that allow us to retrieve the data in a more comfortable set up (e.g. quickfs.net or tikr.com). It is always a good thing to check the datas on official sources like EDGAR. EDGAR is the official SEC (US Security and exchange commission) where we can find official documents on companies. US gov EDGAR The best tool we need for developing quantitative analysis are the Financial statements, remember the past article about stories and numbers. (11. Stories and numbers) \u201cAccounting is the language of business\u201d Warren Buffett When I started my journey in the world of investing, I was afraid about accounting. I started with zero knowledge about this language, but I rapidly noted that not all data is useful. At least, to start, we can have a first idea about a company by looking at a few numbers. If your knowledge about accounting is zero or very minimal, I\u2019ll suggest you to read: \u201cWarren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements: The Search for the Company with a Durable Competitive Advantage\u201d by Mary Buffett Or, if you prefer an educational video: A series of educational videos realized by Prof. Aswath Damoradan (Stern University, NY) Accounting 101 With the following example, I want to analyze with you some useful financial figures, easy to understand even without a CFA. Our aim is to become practitioner investors, not employees of an accounting firm. My goal is to distill the meaningful parts of the process, in order to craft our thesis in a simple manner without too much noise (First principle thinking, remember, when we will talk about Mental models). The final destination is to find companies with strong competitive advantage (14. It\u2019s a war) at a fair price, to buy, hold and let them compound over the long term. \u201cIf the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is almost never.\u201d Phil Fisher Fig.1 Facebook $FB income statement The best is to analyze multiple years of financial, 10 years ideally. In this manner, we can track the number history of the company, and glimpse the evolution over time. In other words, it defines if the company is in healthy condition, and if it is growing overtime. It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand. Fig.3 World War 2 Coca Cola advertising campaign \u201cTo see that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for 5 cents, wherever he is and whatever it costs the Company.\u201d Robert Woodruff, $KO president, 1923-1954 Fig. 4 Coca Cola\u2019s Santa \u201cBefore 1931, there were many different depictions of Santa Claus around the world, including a tall gaunt man and an elf \u2014 there was even a scary Claus. But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin. There are tons of numbers and metrics useful, but we have only one brain, so the best thing to do is try to cut down our cognitive load. \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Albert Einstein That\u2019s my goal with this blog. Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d William N. Thorndike, The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success Finally, net income must be positive! I remember you, our purpose is to find the best company and don\u2019t lose money. More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond. From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.). Time will judge if you made a good choice. It\u2019s always about the allocation of capital. \u201cIf you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings \u2014 assuming the company in question has earnings. As you\u2019ll see in this text, I subscribe to the crusty notion that sooner or later earnings make or break an investment in equities. What the stock price does today, tomorrow, or next week is only a distraction.\u201d Peter Lynch Fig 7. Earnings and capital gain are historically correlated (that\u2019s investing!) As you can see in fig. 6, Lynch\u2019s point is supported by the datas. Like humans, businesses have a life cycle, it\u2019s important to understand where our company stands in its life cycle. Fig 8. Business cycle source: prof Damodaran It\u2019s useful knowing in which stage of its life the company is, in order to better understand the key metrics and what we have to expect the management must do to maximise shareholders returns. This is my semplify thought process through the income statement. Remember that, every industry is different and there are different metrics to focus on, anyway I am trying to summarize the most important factor in the future. I will revisit my analysis of statements with a more granular focus. To be honest, I consider the income statements the least useful of all statements. It\u2019s useful in order to interpret Cash Flow, for example an healthy cash generation depends on increased profits, thanks to income statements we can see the past sales trend. In the Cash flow statement we will see how these sales are converted into real cash. Balance sheet, that is the second statement we will discover! Stay tuned! Warning: All statements represent the past of the company, as investors we need to understand the sustainability of cash generation in the future, in order to do that we need to understand the stories behind our company (11. Stories and numbers) Remember, our goal is to find outstanding business, buy at the right price and hold for the long run. \u201cPut together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years, and so also will the portfolio\u2019s market value.\u201d Warren Buffett Feel free to comment, share my article with friends and subscribe to my newsletter if you like my content and you want to follow me towards financial freedom.

The first thing to do is recovering the financial statements of the company that we have chosen. A good idea is to choose a company within our circle of competence (10. Circle of competence). What we are going to learn: Read an income statement at a glance Focus on the fundamental numbers Extrapolate some metrics Contextualizing the numbers Email Address The goal is to find the best compounder with a competitive advantage. As in the previous article, I will take, again, Facebook (FB) as an example. The first thing to do is to go on Google and digitize \u201cFB investor relations\u201d. Once we are in the investor page we have to open the last earnings release and search for the Statements of Income. Like I explained in the preceding article (12. Starting Point), there are plenty of platforms that allow us to retrieve the data in a more comfortable set up (e.g. quickfs.net or tikr.com). It is always a good thing to check the datas on official sources like EDGAR. EDGAR is the official SEC (US Security and exchange commission) where we can find official documents on companies. US gov EDGAR The best tool we need for developing quantitative analysis are the Financial statements, remember the past article about stories and numbers. (11. Stories and numbers) \u201cAccounting is the language of business\u201d Warren Buffett When I started my journey in the world of investing, I was afraid about accounting. I started with zero knowledge about this language, but I rapidly noted that not all data is useful. At least, to start, we can have a first idea about a company by looking at a few numbers. If your knowledge about accounting is zero or very minimal, I\u2019ll suggest you to read: \u201cWarren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements: The Search for the Company with a Durable Competitive Advantage\u201d by Mary Buffett Or, if you prefer an educational video: A series of educational videos realized by Prof. Aswath Damoradan (Stern University, NY) Accounting 101 With the following example, I want to analyze with you some useful financial figures, easy to understand even without a CFA. Our aim is to become practitioner investors, not employees of an accounting firm. My goal is to distill the meaningful parts of the process, in order to craft our thesis in a simple manner without too much noise (First principle thinking, remember, when we will talk about Mental models). The final destination is to find companies with strong competitive advantage (14. It\u2019s a war) at a fair price, to buy, hold and let them compound over the long term. \u201cIf the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is almost never.\u201d Phil Fisher Fig.1 Facebook $FB income statement The best is to analyze multiple years of financial, 10 years ideally. In this manner, we can track the number history of the company, and glimpse the evolution over time. In other words, it defines if the company is in healthy condition, and if it is growing overtime. It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.). Time will judge if you made a good choice. It\u2019s always about the allocation of capital. \u201cIf you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings \u2014 assuming the company in question has earnings. As you\u2019ll see in this text, I subscribe to the crusty notion that sooner or later earnings make or break an investment in equities. What the stock price does today, tomorrow, or next week is only a distraction.\u201d Peter Lynch Fig 7. Earnings and capital gain are historically correlated (that\u2019s investing!) As you can see in fig. 6, Lynch\u2019s point is supported by the datas. Like humans, businesses have a life cycle, it\u2019s important to understand where our company stands in its life cycle. Fig 8. Business cycle source: prof Damodaran It\u2019s useful knowing in which stage of its life the company is, in order to better understand the key metrics and what we have to expect the management must do to maximise shareholders returns. This is my semplify thought process through the income statement. Remember that, every industry is different and there are different metrics to focus on, anyway I am trying to summarize the most important factor in the future. I will revisit my analysis of statements with a more granular focus. To be honest, I consider the income statements the least useful of all statements. It\u2019s useful in order to interpret Cash Flow, for example an healthy cash generation depends on increased profits, thanks to income statements we can see the past sales trend. In the Cash flow statement we will see how these sales are converted into real cash. Balance sheet, that is the second statement we will discover! Stay tuned! Warning: All statements represent the past of the company, as investors we need to understand the sustainability of cash generation in the future, in order to do that we need to understand the stories behind our company (11. Stories and numbers) Remember, our goal is to find outstanding business, buy at the right price and hold for the long run. \u201cPut together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years, and so also will the portfolio\u2019s market value.\u201d Warren Buffett Feel free to comment, share my article with friends and subscribe to my newsletter if you like my content and you want to follow me towards financial freedom.

It is not intended as a substitute for legal, commercial and/or financial advice from a licensed professional. Here we go! The first thing to do is recovering the financial statements of the company that we have chosen. A good idea is to choose a company within our circle of competence (10. Circle of competence). What we are going to learn: Read an income statement at a glance Focus on the fundamental numbers Extrapolate some metrics Contextualizing the numbers Email Address The goal is to find the best compounder with a competitive advantage. As in the previous article, I will take, again, Facebook (FB) as an example. The first thing to do is to go on Google and digitize \u201cFB investor relations\u201d. Once we are in the investor page we have to open the last earnings release and search for the Statements of Income. Like I explained in the preceding article (12. Starting Point), there are plenty of platforms that allow us to retrieve the data in a more comfortable set up (e.g. quickfs.net or tikr.com). It is always a good thing to check the datas on official sources like EDGAR. EDGAR is the official SEC (US Security and exchange commission) where we can find official documents on companies. US gov EDGAR The best tool we need for developing quantitative analysis are the Financial statements, remember the past article about stories and numbers. (11. Stories and numbers) \u201cAccounting is the language of business\u201d Warren Buffett When I started my journey in the world of investing, I was afraid about accounting. I started with zero knowledge about this language, but I rapidly noted that not all data is useful. At least, to start, we can have a first idea about a company by looking at a few numbers. If your knowledge about accounting is zero or very minimal, I\u2019ll suggest you to read: \u201cWarren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements: The Search for the Company with a Durable Competitive Advantage\u201d by Mary Buffett Or, if you prefer an educational video: A series of educational videos realized by Prof. Aswath Damoradan (Stern University, NY) Accounting 101 With the following example, I want to analyze with you some useful financial figures, easy to understand even without a CFA. Our aim is to become practitioner investors, not employees of an accounting firm. My goal is to distill the meaningful parts of the process, in order to craft our thesis in a simple manner without too much noise (First principle thinking, remember, when we will talk about Mental models). The final destination is to find companies with strong competitive advantage (14. It\u2019s a war) at a fair price, to buy, hold and let them compound over the long term. \u201cIf the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is almost never.\u201d Phil Fisher Fig.1 Facebook $FB income statement The best is to analyze multiple years of financial, 10 years ideally. In this manner, we can track the number history of the company, and glimpse the evolution over time. In other words, it defines if the company is in healthy condition, and if it is growing overtime. It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand. Fig.3 World War 2 Coca Cola advertising campaign \u201cTo see that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for 5 cents, wherever he is and whatever it costs the Company.\u201d Robert Woodruff, $KO president, 1923-1954 Fig. 4 Coca Cola\u2019s Santa \u201cBefore 1931, there were many different depictions of Santa Claus around the world, including a tall gaunt man and an elf \u2014 there was even a scary Claus. But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin. There are tons of numbers and metrics useful, but we have only one brain, so the best thing to do is try to cut down our cognitive load. \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Albert Einstein That\u2019s my goal with this blog. Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d William N. Thorndike, The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success Finally, net income must be positive! I remember you, our purpose is to find the best company and don\u2019t lose money. More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond. From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages.

Medieval village allocated in a strategic defensive position \u2013 Pitigliano, Grossetto (Tuscany, Italy) Photographer: Jenny \u201cIn business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats\u201d Warren Buffett Capitalism is like life, it is a war. Our goal is to find the best fortress where to put our capital, ideally a fortress with a wide moat, and a smart and powerful lord.In the course of human history, battlegrounds have changed but not the nature of humans, we can\u2019t neglect our nature, we are born to fight because throughout the fight we built a better and enhanced society. This is exactly the purpose of capitalism, and we are all involved in this mechanics.It\u2019s possible to simply become lazy and stop fighting, typically that happens at the peak of a civilization (i.e US trade deficit). Then another civilization takes over, and lets the old one die.Look around you, most of the western products, brands, lands are now owned by asian and developing countries. Why does this happen? Because they want to fight. (e.g. 100% Volvo and 10% Mercedes-Benz owned by Geely (China), lands and buildings in Milan \u2013 COIMA RES owned by Qatar, \u2026).How do we fight in this new world? We have to learn to adapt. In other words: stop scrolling social media like zombies, bring a book and start reading and develop new skills (shields and swords). Fig. 2 Rise and decline empire source: Ray Dalio Note that: education is the first signal of decline, followed by competitiveness. \u201cIn effect, we know from Darwin that there are only four characteristics necessary in order to get adaptive evolution, right? If you have reproduction, variation, differential success, and an environment of limited resources, you\u2019re going to get adaptive evolution. When we set up an economic system, or a political system\u2026*it evolves*. Things evolve within it.\u201d Bret Weinstein, Biologist, PhD Why we fight? We fight because our planet has limited resources, and we need to use them efficiently, this is the only way to survive as human beings. We have to destroy what doesn\u2019t work anymore to build what will work better and efficiently. (E.g., renewable energy are going to destroy oil/gas, e-commerce vs brick and mortar, cryptocurrencies vs FIAT currencies, AI/blockchain/data are going to automatize bureaucracy and will free our species from the burden of bureaucracy/routine works in order to free our limited time and unleash our creativity.) Imagine a future world, with 30 billion people, where we will occupe thousands of surface meters to allocate gigantic off-line malls. Doesn\u2019t seem an efficient way to occupy the limited space of our planet, it seems better to have an efficient warehouse coordinated by robots with a virtual showcase ($AMZN) in a metaverse (SEHK700) where we can walk around thanks to virtual reality ($FB). That could permit free space for gigantic woods and parks in the real world. Maybe once there was a desert, now it was a forest. Maybe Thanks to a startup like Solar Water, where you have invested, that uses solar energy to power a desalination plant).Then stop complaining about the fact you are going to lose your job because of automation. You will lose it, it\u2019s unavoidable. Learn to adapt!Worry about an algorithm will substitute your work? Find the MOAT company, maybe a SaaS, save and invest in the company that develops this product, and gain from the future dividends and buybacks, buy it a fair price! (7. How the companies reward us). If you work well at the end you will retire from work and start doing whatever you want. Who will be the final opponent? Probably AI, I think automatization and algorithmes are going to push our species to the next level (or maybe singularity? Checkmate :P). Fig. 3 Chess champion Kasparov while he lose against Deep Blue \u201cAI ever allows us to truly understand ourselves, it will not be because these algorithms captured the mechanical essence of the human mind. It will be because they liberated us to forget about optimizations and to instead focus on what truly makes us human: loving and being loved.\u201d Kai-Fu Lee, PhD, Computer Science Mellon University (Guess who is strongly competing to develop the best AI infrastructure? China.) But for now, in order to evolve, is our responsibility (extinction is the alternative) to correctly allocate the limited resources available, thus we have to find a good Lord that will do this work for us.Indeed, the most important characteristic of a lord is exactly related to his ability in the capital allocation in order to expand the village, defend it, and make the best use of the available resources. Remember the notion of capital allocation, because we are going to talk about it in the next articles. Now the castle is named corporation and the lord is named CEO, but there is always a war to fight.As shareholders we are kings, and we need to preserve our wealth from the attacks of the enemies. Fig. 4 Economic moat source: getmoneyrich.com Why do I tell you this story? Because in next articles we are going to find the characteristics of a good castle and dig deeper about the qualities of a good lord, and how a good moat is built. Eventually the moat reassures us, if business has an advantage over the competitors, this advantage increases the reliability of our forecast about future cash generated by our company. Over the long run many competitors are going to try to take a piece of the pie (i.e., users, customers, revenue, cash flow). We need to defend our wealth.In the future we are going to talk also about, like a king, how much lands you need in order to increase your wealth (portfolio). \u201cEquity is the new land. Shareholder is the new landowner\u201d Naval Ravikant Economic MOAT In 1980 the academic Michael Porter wrote the book \u201cCompetitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors\u201d. In this book Porter described the five main forces which protect the profitability of a business. Fig. 5 Porter\u2019s 5 forces \u201cIncidentally, that\u2019s one of the things we look for in businesses; if you see a business take a lot of adversity and still do well, that tells you something about the underlying strength of the business\u2026 a way of evaluating the depth and impenetrability of the moat.\u201d Warren Buffett Financial moat gives us more certainty about future cash flow, reducing the intrinsic uncertainty of the humans\u2019 world. As you can see in figure 5 this moat could has various forms, in this blog we are going to dig the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of some of this moat Then when I will tell you about moat, you will know my purpose.During this blog we are going to develop a series of mental models that give us a better understanding of our world. Biology and evolution are two of these models, and history is another one. In the past, I had already written about psychology (8. Mr. Market). Those concepts mix together give us the basis of our mindset as investors for the long haul. \u201cDeveloping the habit of mastering the multiple models which underlie reality is the best thing you can do\u201d Charlie Munger (ELI5 mental models: a series of tools or ideas brought from the hard or soft science and applied to a complex argument, typically finance because of his complex and adaptive nature). Learn, train, take risks. In other words, fight! In this sense my blog\u2019s goal is to become your intellectual trainer and sparring partner. Following chapter 15.

Noah\u2019s ark In the first part of our overview, we analyzed the income statement, now we are going to look at the capital structure of our business, namely: the balance sheet. If earnings are our engine, the balance sheet is the frame of our machine. I like using allegory to make the point, in this case a good one could be the hull of a boat. In the holy bible Noah was a God\u2019s prophet, in his days the God warned Noah about the advent of a catastrophic flooding, and he ordered him to build a boat in order to survive. God gives to Noah the technical specificity of the ark. Time passes but there is always an upcoming apocalypse to worry about, it is the cyclical nature of our universe. If we invest for the long run, our boat has to survive financial floods and storms, in other words: bubbles and bust (Article Stock Market Crash). There are some characteristics that make our boat apocalypse-proof. We always hear about financial crises, our duty is not to anticipate these events (it is quite impossible), rather, it is to be on board the right boat. When the flood comes the action to do isn\u2019t throw yourself out in the middle of the storm, instead, choose the right boat before the storm comes, and never leave them and rather give it more \u201cfinancial fuel\u201d, \u201cour money\u201d. \u201cEvery decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it\u2019s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying wash tubs, not teaspoons\u201d Warren Buffett What we are going to learn: Understand the meaning of the balance sheet Read a balance sheet statement at a glance Focus on fundamental numbers and extrapolate some metrics Contextualize the number within the business maturation stage Email Address In the first part of my article 15. income statements analysis, we spoke about the predictability of the future earnings. Predictability is warranted by the company\u2019s competitive advantage (Article 14. it\u2019s a war). The MOAT is principally tied to our story and confirmed by the past performance, the track record which gives us insight on the management ability to conduct the business. Today, we analyze the present structure of the business, as God gives Noah instruction on how to build the ark. We are going to dig into the key figures that tell us if the company can survive a financial storm. When the monetary and fiscal policy are relaxed, even weak companies survive, as is the case nowadays with low interest rates and quantitative easing environment, but what happens if something changes and the financial environment becomes hostile? We need a business which can survive in two types of environment: liquidity contraction and/or highly inflationary (5.1 Appendix \u2013 Currency Value). We cannot predict the macro events nor timing the market, but we can do an engineering valuation of our boat. If the hull of the boat is not solid, we are not going to see the future cash flow of our business. After this intro, let\u2019s go to check if our boat has some leaks. \u201cIt is well to consider the financial strength and debt structure to see if a few bad years would hinder the company\u2019s long-term progress.\u201d Peter Lynch Lynch also refers to the Balance Sheet as a \u201cSurvivability factor\u201d. fig 2. Facebook 2020 Balance Sheet source: Edgar Foundation. The balance sheet shows what a company owns and owes, and how much shareholders have invested in. The formula: Assets = Liabilities + Equity Fig 3. Formula This is the basic formula of the balance sheet equilibrium, and it is the alloy that makes up the hull of our boat. Assets Anything of value, which has a cash value and/or generates cash, i.e.: cash, buildings, infrastractures,.. A few examples: Company = farm\u2019s truck: utilized to grow oats which once sold generate cash. Individual = house: rented for income Note: Usually, if inflation goes up, the value of assets already in place go up compared to the book value (replacement cost). Liabilities Something (i.e., assets) owed to somebody else. An example: Every sort of debt, often used to finances the acquisition of an assets, which will generate cash to repaid the debt interest, and generate additional income (e.g., mortgage) Here we can note the importance of producing more earnings than the cost of the obligation (interest rate) aka Return On Capital employed. If not, the company is burning cash. In other words, if I assume a debt of 100 and I have to pay an 1% interest, and I use this money to develop a project which returns < 1%, we are paying more, respect to our return, that is called Value Destruction. I will go into the details in the Ratio Section of this article. Examples: commercial paper, bills, notes, bonds, etc. An advice by the GOAT \u201cCompanies that have no debt can\u2019t go bankrupt.\u201d Peter Lynch \u201cFirst rules of investing, never lose money\u201d Warren Buffett Here the importance of capital structure, bankruptcy is one of the few cases where you could lose all of your money overnight, the rest is stock volatility. Even if the company manages to service its debt, this payment decreases the cash flow available to pay shareholders. When a company downsizes its debt burden, it releases money for shareholders: dividends, repurchases and investments. Remember: the true nature of investing regards the money the company pays us, not the price set by Mr. Market. (article 8. Mr Market) Equity Simply put, this is your piece of the cake. What amount of money, hypothetically, would be returned to you as an owner if the company would be liquidated. Equity can also be called book value. For some sectors or businesses, book value per share can be a useful metric (notoriously in the past Warren Buffett buybacks $BRK stock under 1.2 times book value, as a sort of proxy to define the intrinsic value, indeed a smooth growth in equity could be a good sign). Example: individual = Equity is what belongs to you after you deduct the mortgage of your house from the total value, that\u2019s the Equity of your home. It is composed by two essential parts: Original investment and later investment Retaining earnings: is the percentage of profit that was not paid as dividend/buybacks, accumulated overtime and can be reinvested for new projects and acquisition or used to pay off debt. As usual there is not a magic formula. However, in the example of the previous article, the best companies don\u2019t need external fuel, but those companies use their profit as fuel. In other words they are self-financed. Another example: Alibaba uses e-commerce main business as a fuel generator for AliCloud and Venture Capitalist investment not yet profitable. You can see the potential of a business that has excess cash to deploy in a series of new projects, even in uncharted and risky territory. These ventures are named optionality and companies like this are named spawners. Based on the description by Mohnish Pabrai, a spawner is a company with \u201cDNA, which reflects a deep conviction in the importance of relentlessly adding and incubating new businesses that have the potential to be massive growth engines.\u201d As every equation we can extrapolate the variable we want to calculate, for example: Shareholders\u2019 Net Worth (Equity) = Assets \u2013 Liabilities If we divide it by the number of shares we obtain the book value per share (bvps). BVPS = Shareholders equity / number of shares. Now it is clear why the Balance sheets are useful and important, because they define what we own, as investors. Intangible Something forgotten by accounting is the importance of intangible assets, namely the money spent by the company in order to develop new technologies (Research & Development R&D) for developing a brand (Sales, General and Administrative SG&A), for training specialized labor forces (COGS) or create a new intellectual property. These items are not capitalized (transformed into an asset then depreciated overtime), but those intangibles have a long term value, mostly in our tech oriented society. In other words, this money spent will generate real assets, even if they are not represented in the balance sheet, rather those intangible assets are treated as cost and immediate expense. Brand, franchising, trained labor, intellectual property, customer lists, reputation, culture, loyal employees, data, those are only some examples which share some of the features of physical assets, and they can generate cash flow over time. Mickey Mouse could be a good example. Mickey was the creation of two brilliant minds, Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. These two guys have spent energy in order to draw and develop this character, in the form of time, money and brain power. This energy has been converted into one of the most notorious and valuable fictional characters of all time, imagine how much money $DIS extrapolate from this creative work (e.g., comics, books, parks, merchandising,\u2026). \u201cin 1966 people said \u201cWell, Mary Poppins is terrific this year, but they [Disney] are not going to have another Mary Poppins next year, so the earnings will be down.\u201d I don\u2019t care if the earnings are down like that. You know you\u2019ve still got Mary Poppins to throw out in seven more years, assuming kids squawk a little. I mean there\u2019s no better system than to have something where, essentially, you get a new crop every seven years and you get to charge more each time.\u201d Warren Buffett We all know how many cash crops Disney made over the last 70 years thanks to the large number of characters owned by the company. Intellectual properties could be an eternal money mine with the difference that a mine needs physical infrastructures which in turns needs maintenance, Mickey not. Furthermore nobody else can own a Mickey Mouse. What does this mean? In an inflationary environment, your maintenance/replacements costs are going to increase, reducing the profit margin, that doesn\u2019t happen with IP (intellectual property). Other than that, its life expectancy is sustained by its current age, as it is the case for Mickey (Lindy effect). Then rather than depreciate, often intangibles gain value proportionally to their age, the passage of time crystallizes the brand recognition in the customers minds, namely mindshare, a notion already discussed in the past article. In this sense, also my blog is an intangible asset, my hope is to create something that can generate value for the readers and last over time. Fig 4. Mickey mouse in command of our ship \u201cI only hope that we never lose sight of one thing \u2013 that it was all started by a mouse\u201d Walt Disney, Disneyland, October 27, 1954 Where the intellectual works of Disney are presented in its balance sheet? Obviously this is an extreme example. But it is worth noting that the Disney empire is founded on assets which do not appear on the balance sheet, it will appear only if someone, in a hypothetical future, will buy Disney. Because of the earnings power, the buyer will have to pay a premium over the equity. This premium is named Goodwill, but doesn\u2019t exist in the previous balance sheet of the acquired company, because the assets are not tangible. Another example: FaceBook/Instagram/Whatsapp \u2013 Network effect. (Thanks Zuck!) Does it remind you of something? MOAT? Be careful, it seems that the secret sauce of a great business does not lie in a figure of the balance sheet. (Article 14. it\u2019s a war) As a reminder of the last article. Income statement analysis, it is useful to remember that profit earned by a business and reported in the income statement are also recorded in the balance sheet,and it increases the Retained earnings figure under the equity section. Balance sheet lines analyze Made the necessary premises, now is time to analyze the balance sheet lines. Fig 5. Capital structure source: Professor Aswath Damodaran Assets Current assets Assets expected to be used by business operations in the next 12 months. Include: Cash and cash equivalents, account receivable, inventory, marketable security and other liquid assets. Cash and cash equivalent. These are assets owned by the company that are cash or can be converted into cash immediately (e.g., marketable security). How much cash is it good to have? As usual there is not a unique answer, but from what I saw, it\u2019s always a good thing. Mostly during prosperity periods, to accumulate some cash. That is because when a storm arrives, cash gives us fuel to weather the storm, and other than that, if our CEO is a great capital allocator, he will take advantage of the crisis acquiring assets at a discount and consequently with a high Return on Investment (ROI). Even a great company will suffer damage during a storm, the goal is survive and thrive in the post flood environment. Usually after a storm, weak companies drown, and the industry consolidates, permitting the fittest to thrive and acquiring good assets. \u201cAntifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.\u201d Nassim Nicolas Taleb That does not mean it is good to hoard an exaggerated quantity of money, but if there is not a great opportunity it is better to retain some cash, at minimum some cash or liquid assets sufficient to cover short liabilities. \u201cWe just want to get through the typhoon, and we\u2019d rather come out of it with a whole lot of liquidity\u201d Charlie Munger referring to Berkshire Hathaway $BRK Finally, I want to remind you of a fundamental principle of investing, we, as investors, buy a business not a stock. Often, a market crisis is caused by a liquidity contraction (e.g. increases interest -> decreases circulating money -> average Joe: \u201cI sell my s&p 500 index in the worst moment possible because I\u2019ve to refinance my liabilities at a high rate then I need some money\u201c, this phenomenon causes also the stock price of good company to nosedive, a great management with money at hand will buybacks stocks and that permits us to increase our slice of the pie (7. How company reward us). And you have to do the same, increase your stakes in great companies! \u201cIn the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity\u201d Sun Tzu Account Receivable Account Receivables (AR) are debts owed to the company by its customers for goods or service already delivered. If it grows overtime, it could be the sign that customers are unable or unwilling to pay, a warning sign that is worth digging. If the AR are too low it could be a sign of the company\u2019s rigidity in its payment terms to its customers. The risk is that the company will not be able to recover the money due, forcing the company to write off the AR. Inventory Raw materials, work in process and finished goods. A company has in its stock that material will ultimately be sold. When an item is sold, its carrying cost transfers to the COGS Cost Of Good Sold(article income statement). How to value inventory. Holding an inventory as a cost, moreover products tend to become obsolete (think about the inventory with iPhone when Apple throws out a new model). Consequently it is better to have a quick turnover cycle depending on the industry. Inventory turnover: COGS / Average inventory. The results tell us how many times per year a company sold its entire inventory. Inventory growth > Sales growth = red flag. Warning: an inventory turnover too high can mean that the company does not have sufficient inventory to cover the demands. \u201cExamples abound of how considerable increases in inventory and/or accounts receivable can forecast downward earnings and surprises. This is especially true in those industries subject to rapid changes in products and taste. Expect to find them in companies dealing with high fashion, seasonal goods, and especially high tech. No investor seriously involved with stocks in these industries can afford to ignore accounts receivable and inventories.\u201d Thorton L. O\u2019Glove, Quality of Earnings Deferred tax assets This asset is usually created when a business incurs a loss in a financial year (NOL: Net Operating Loss) or a company overpaid or paid in advance taxes. It can be carried over indefinitely and can be used to reduce future tax liability. Non-current assets Noncurrent assets are assets tangible or intangible that will benefit the company for more than one year. PP&E, long term investment, goodwill. Gross Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) Tangible long term assets also known as Fixed Assets: machinery, computers, office equipment, vehicles, furniture, buildings, lands. Accumulated depreciation As explained in the last article (15. Income statements analysis) is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, this involves the reduction of its accounting value. Net PP&E The results from the depreciation of our assets over time. Gross PP&E \u2013 Accumulated depreciation. In other words, the remaining accounting value of our physical assets. As you can imagine, this is an accounting trick, some assets behave in an opposite manner, gaining value over time. Some investors are specialized in finding this type of imbalance, where the value of the asset is more than its accounting value. Peter Lynch named them \u201cAsset Play\u201d, the same notion can be applicable to the intangible assets which are not even presented. \u201cConsider tor example that generally accepted accounting principles permit a firm to write of a factory over 20 years, using straight line depreciation. Suppose the property cost $20 million originally. Would you say it was worth only $5 million after fifteen years? That is what the company\u2019s books would indicate, but given the nature of the real estate market, that building might fetch $30 million or more. Yet every year the firm deducted an item of $1 million lor factory depreciation, when perhaps it would have been more realistic to add a million for appreciation.\u201d Quality of earnings, Thornton L. O\u2019glove Long term investment Like us, companies also invest in securities such as: stocks, bonds, real estate, cash. This investment is intended to be held for more than a year. Goodwill I explained goodwill in the last article. A \u201cgoodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not.\u201d The balance sheet represents the present value of this intangible asset netted by impairments. A warning sign could be a high percentage of goodwill over assets, it\u2019s worth digging on the capital allocation ability of the CEO. For example, if a company pays $1 mio to buy another company that has net assets of $500k, they are going to have $500k of goodwill on their balance sheet. The net assets that they have acquired for $500k cost to them more than if they are to buy the business components separately. If it turns out that the whole acquired company doesn\u2019t generate the expected Cash Flow over time, they would need to start impairing the goodwill asset. If a company keeps acquiring assets or entire companies and later they regularly charge impairment related to them, it\u2019s a red flag, you have to dig on this or pass. Instead if impairments are sporadic events, say one in the last 5 years, it may not be a major problem. Liabilities Current liabilities Short term financial obligations that are due in the next 12 months, including account payable, deferred revenue, short term debt, dividends, notes payable, taxes owed. Account Payable Account payables (AP) are amounts due to suppliers for services or goods received, but not yet paid. It is a sort of short term loan, indeed lengthening the payment time is a source of cash for the company. AP are the liabilities counterpart of the AR (Account Receivables), previously analyzed. Deferred/unearned revenue Advance payments: a company received service/products not yet delivered. Not represented in the income until service/product will be delivered, but it will be shown in the cash flow statement when cash is received. Revenue recognition means that the revenue can only be recognized when the revenue process is complete, payment has been made and the good/service has been delivered. A common example could be a subscription-based product or services that require prepayments. Short term borrowing Financial obligations that are expected to be paid within a year. Non current liabilities Financial obligations that are not due within the upcoming year, long term debt and leases. Long term debt Debts are not necessarily bad, but could become a big problem. Debt is useful and its scope is to generate wealth in our society. A good starting point in order to understand the role of debt is a video made by Ray Dalio (How economic machine works). However, debt is a social problem. When an individual, a business or a society brings more debt than is productive output, there could be a problem (unless you are the reserve currency printer, namely US, but this is another story \u2013 Lyn Alden Petrodollar). Fig 6. Public US debt % GDP Interest rates are low then, having some debt, could be a good idea, but only if that more money is used to generate wealth in the long term. For example, having a huge pile of debts and paying high dividends to the shareholders may seem a good idea, but in reality is the sign of a myopic management with a short term vision. High level of debt means high level of interest to pay, this interest will reduce the cash our business can pay to us as owners, moreover this debt burden must be rapaid sooner or later, reducing future cash generation. Some companies rather than lower their dividend and lose their investors, those companies use debt to payout dividends, that increases debt services and reduces the future gain. In other words, it is the action of a short-sighted management and it will be detrimental for long term shareholders. It is useful to compare cash and long term debt in order to understand how much net debt the company has. Why do some companies have cash and debt? There are many reasons. The first reason is the tax advantage. Another reason worth noting is that some companies are international, then they have assets in foreign currency exposed to local devaluation risks to compensate for this devaluation the company takes a debt in the same currency, in order to take advantage of local currency devaluation without trapping money in countries with weak currency. Leases Lease is a contract between two parties, where the lessee pays the lessors for an asset use. Be careful, capital leases are counted as liabilities. A new FASB rule, effective Dec. 15, 2018, requires that all leases unless they are shorter than 12 months must be recognized on the balance sheet. Number of common stock We have already discussed the notion of share repurchases (how companies reward us). I want to highlight an aspect, companies not only repurchase shares, but sometimes they issue new fresh stocks, having the opposite effect: namely diluting the stocks count thus devaluing the value of a single stock. You can think that: stocks are like money, a store of value. Companies can pay investors, employees or even what they need with stocks. We, as investors gain, when there are fewer stocks, because in this manner we own a big piece of the cake. On the other hand the management could pay itself and the employer with stocks (Stock Based Compensation). Nothing wrong about it, if employees and management are themselves owners could mean that they act like owners in the interest of us, as investors. This is a complex argument that needs a separate article, but it is worth remembering for the next article where we are going to analyze the cash flow. Other than that it is good to look at the number of share counts over time in order to understand if the company is diluting our earning participation. The management must treat shares as if they are gold bullions, nothing wrong using stock as a currency, but only if the exchange is worth our gold bullions. Fig 7. $AAPL How a good CEO makes his shareholders rich through share repurchases managing the balance sheet When you are trying to catch the last overpriced hot stock with uncertain financial future, remember this chart and think about how the wealth is created. Wealth is created over time by a cash machine business and a management aligned with shareholder interest! (Berkshire Hathaways $BRK case study) Since Tim Cook became CEO of Apple 10 years ago the stock soared 1022% (ten bagger). Net Working Capital (NWC) The NWC is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. NWC tells us the operational efficiency of the business, in other word the ability to reduce the costs and improve the gain in the short term transaction. If a company has positive working capital, it means that it has the ability to invest money in the business. The goal is to cover operating expenses while using assets in the most productive manner. As usual, one of the most important goals is resource optimization. NWC = Current Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities A negative working capital suggests there will be trouble to pay the short term debts. The consequence could be the reduction of Cash Flow in order to weather the short term liquidity issues. Ratios and metrics Ratios are useful to compare the historical data and data between companies, it is worth remembering that capital structure can vary between sector and maturation stage (e.g., Some capital intensive sectors have a huge debt burden. That could be a normal or a mature company with stable earnings that could have an high credit rating, thus this will pay much less in borrowing costs. ) Fig 8. Company life stages source: Prof Aswath Damodaran The table on fig. 8 by Prof Aswath Damoradan is useful to contextualize the figures, every stage of the life of the company has its optimal blend of assets/debt/equity. Return on Equity (ROE) ROE measures the financial performance and corporate profitability of assets owned by investors. It is useful to define the ability of the management to make profit with our money. It defines how much profit is generated for each shareholder dollar. Earnings growth can never exceed ROE. Be careful, a high ROE is not a guarantee of growth. ROE = Net income / average shareholders\u2019 equity \u201cFocus on Return on Equity, not earnings per share\u201d Warren Buffett Be wary, in order to understand the results we have to know the capital structure. Basically, if equity is the result of Assets \u2013 liabilities, the more liabilities we have the higher is the ROE. Keep in mind, there is not a magic formula, but we need a holistic approach. Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Similar to ROE but with a different denominator, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is used to evaluate the capital allocation ability on total available capital. ROA = Net income /Total assets ROIC = Net income / (Debt + Equity) ROIC > Cost Of Capital = Value Creation ROIC < Cost Of Capital = Value Destruction The deal is finding a business which produces a high ROIC, and it can deploy all its earned cash at the same high ROIC, this would be a legendary business. Unfortunately businesses like that are very rare, indeed Buffett structured the Berkshire Hathaway holding using cash generated by high ROIC business in new projects with high ROIC, here is where the power of compounding takes form(article link compounding). Usually High ROIC businesses deploy this cash to payout dividend or repurchase shares, in the worst case those will deploy cash in low ROIC businesses destroying value through \u201cdiworsification\u201d (over expansion of a company into new projects it does not fully understand and which does not align with the competencies of the management/outside circle of competence. Reference: One Upon Wall Street, Peter Lynch) Time Warner AOL example \u201cAOL Time Warner (2001\u20132003)\u201d Fig 9. ROIC table return source: McKinsey \u201cOver the long term, it\u2019s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you\u2019re not going to make much difference than a 6% return\u2014even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you\u2019ll end up with a fine result.\u201d Charlie Munger Fig 10. High P/E returns source: Terry Smith Fund \u2013 L\u2019Oreal, Altria Group, The Hershey Company, Colgate Fig 11. ROIC \u2013 L\u2019Oreal, Altria Group, The Hershey Company, Colgate Please Note: Fund Smith\u2019s table represents returns from 1973 while my ROIC data have a limited timeframe, however consider that usually overtime ROIC tends to decrease because competitors are attracted by high profits, and enter into market and subtracts returns from the incumbent. However, if a company has a competitive advantage, the MOAT will protect the ROIC. Even if you pay a high price, over the long term if you buy a great company with a high return on capital your Total Shareholder Return (TSR) will be good. It is worth remembering that these metrics are alway past looking, in other words we are looking at past performance. Past data are useful to understand the management ability, but they are not certainties for future returns. \u201cIn the business world, unfortunately, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the windshield.\u201d Warren Buffett This means two things: The art of investing is the ability to use past numbers and stories to help us to hypothesize the existence of a MOAT, and the ability of the management to defend and improve this MOAT over time. That is the secret to maintaining the past performances. We, as investors, use this data and our future outlook to choose the investment with the best probabilistic chance to realize a gain. For that reason I\u2019m obsessed with the idea of finding companies with a wide competitive advantage. The past uses of capital is a responsibility of the management and condition of the past. It is entirely possible that the recent Capital Allocation has become better or worse, but our metrics pay the price of past weak decisions (e.g., if management in the past overpay for an asset, this excess can weigh on the balance sheet). Ideally, we want to assess the present capital allocation decision, but almost always, we have the data of the entire asset\u2019s story of the business, and we can\u2019t assess the Return of Capital for every single project. Debt to Equity D/E = Debt / Equity It is important to highlight: the ideal debt to equity proportion depends on the sector and the maturity stage of the company. A ratio of 2 or higher is considered risky. Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) Company ability to service its debts obligations ICR = Earnings before interest and taxes / Interest expenses A ICR of 1.5 is considered the minimum acceptable. Note: Interest expenses are shown in the cash flow statement, we will analyze it in the next article. Quick Ratio (Acid Test) Company ability to to pay down current debt using near cash assets. QR = (Cash + Securities + Receivables) / Current Liabilities Ideally a company should have a ratio of 1 or higher. Enterprise Value (EV) The Enterprise value offers a more comprehensive and clear picture of the real value of a company. EV enterprise value = total debt + market capitalization \u2013 cash Basically is how much is needed to buy the entire company. The EV could be an useful tool to analyze the business from a different perspective, and helps investors to have a broad vision on the capital structure of the business. It is useful to compare business in the same industry. Fig 11. Enterprise Value Enterprise value (EV) / operating earnings (EBIT) EV/EBIT A ratio below 10 is retained cheap. I want to highlight the thought of one of the most influential economists of the 20th century: \u201cIn chemistry and physics and other natural sciences the object of experiment is to fill in the actual values of the various quantities and factors appearing in an equation or a formula; and the work when done is once and for all. In economics that is not the case, and to convert a model into a quantitative formula is to destroy its usefulness as an instrument of thought.\u201d JM Keynes Investing is an art, formulas are useful, but the complexity of investing cannot be captured by a mathematical formula. Note: Financial sector has different rules (outside my circle of competence), within this sector high level debt could be normal. In the next chapter I am going to focus on what shareholders really care about: cash available for operations and investments! That is the Cash Flow statements, stay tuned!

The first thing to do is recovering the financial statements of the company that we have chosen. A good idea is to choose a company within our circle of competence (10. Circle of competence). What we are going to learn: Read an income statement at a glance Focus on the fundamental numbers Extrapolate some metrics Contextualizing the numbers Email Address The goal is to find the best compounder with a competitive advantage. As in the previous article, I will take, again, Facebook (FB) as an example. The first thing to do is to go on Google and digitize \u201cFB investor relations\u201d. Once we are in the investor page we have to open the last earnings release and search for the Statements of Income. Like I explained in the preceding article (12. Starting Point), there are plenty of platforms that allow us to retrieve the data in a more comfortable set up (e.g. quickfs.net or tikr.com). It is always a good thing to check the datas on official sources like EDGAR. EDGAR is the official SEC (US Security and exchange commission) where we can find official documents on companies. US gov EDGAR The best tool we need for developing quantitative analysis are the Financial statements, remember the past article about stories and numbers. (11. Stories and numbers) \u201cAccounting is the language of business\u201d Warren Buffett When I started my journey in the world of investing, I was afraid about accounting. I started with zero knowledge about this language, but I rapidly noted that not all data is useful. At least, to start, we can have a first idea about a company by looking at a few numbers. If your knowledge about accounting is zero or very minimal, I\u2019ll suggest you to read: \u201cWarren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements: The Search for the Company with a Durable Competitive Advantage\u201d by Mary Buffett Or, if you prefer an educational video: A series of educational videos realized by Prof. Aswath Damoradan (Stern University, NY) Accounting 101 With the following example, I want to analyze with you some useful financial figures, easy to understand even without a CFA. Our aim is to become practitioner investors, not employees of an accounting firm. My goal is to distill the meaningful parts of the process, in order to craft our thesis in a simple manner without too much noise (First principle thinking, remember, when we will talk about Mental models). The final destination is to find companies with strong competitive advantage (14. It\u2019s a war) at a fair price, to buy, hold and let them compound over the long term. \u201cIf the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is almost never.\u201d Phil Fisher Fig.1 Facebook $FB income statement The best is to analyze multiple years of financial, 10 years ideally. In this manner, we can track the number history of the company, and glimpse the evolution over time. In other words, it defines if the company is in healthy condition, and if it is growing overtime. It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand. Fig.3 World War 2 Coca Cola advertising campaign \u201cTo see that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for 5 cents, wherever he is and whatever it costs the Company.\u201d Robert Woodruff, $KO president, 1923-1954 Fig. 4 Coca Cola\u2019s Santa \u201cBefore 1931, there were many different depictions of Santa Claus around the world, including a tall gaunt man and an elf \u2014 there was even a scary Claus. But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin. There are tons of numbers and metrics useful, but we have only one brain, so the best thing to do is try to cut down our cognitive load. \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Albert Einstein That\u2019s my goal with this blog. Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d William N. Thorndike, The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success Finally, net income must be positive! I remember you, our purpose is to find the best company and don\u2019t lose money. More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond. From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.). Time will judge if you made a good choice. It\u2019s always about the allocation of capital. \u201cIf you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings \u2014 assuming the company in question has earnings. As you\u2019ll see in this text, I subscribe to the crusty notion that sooner or later earnings make or break an investment in equities. What the stock price does today, tomorrow, or next week is only a distraction.\u201d Peter Lynch Fig 7. Earnings and capital gain are historically correlated (that\u2019s investing!) As you can see in fig. 6, Lynch\u2019s point is supported by the datas. Like humans, businesses have a life cycle, it\u2019s important to understand where our company stands in its life cycle. Fig 8. Business cycle source: prof Damodaran It\u2019s useful knowing in which stage of its life the company is, in order to better understand the key metrics and what we have to expect the management must do to maximise shareholders returns. This is my semplify thought process through the income statement. Remember that, every industry is different and there are different metrics to focus on, anyway I am trying to summarize the most important factor in the future. I will revisit my analysis of statements with a more granular focus. To be honest, I consider the income statements the least useful of all statements. It\u2019s useful in order to interpret Cash Flow, for example an healthy cash generation depends on increased profits, thanks to income statements we can see the past sales trend. In the Cash flow statement we will see how these sales are converted into real cash. Balance sheet, that is the second statement we will discover! Stay tuned! Warning: All statements represent the past of the company, as investors we need to understand the sustainability of cash generation in the future, in order to do that we need to understand the stories behind our company (11. Stories and numbers) Remember, our goal is to find outstanding business, buy at the right price and hold for the long run. \u201cPut together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years, and so also will the portfolio\u2019s market value.\u201d Warren Buffett Feel free to comment, share my article with friends and subscribe to my newsletter if you like my content and you want to follow me towards financial freedom.

Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years. Below is an extract from the book \u201cThe Outsiders\u201d, where the author highlights the importance of frugality as a quality of an outstanding CEO. \u201cA story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture\u2014one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, \u201cIs there any other way?\u201d William N. Thorndike, The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success Finally, net income must be positive! I remember you, our purpose is to find the best company and don\u2019t lose money. More years of profit means that management has done its work well, and it i\u2019s a point in favor of the reliability of the future direction. If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond. From financial datas we can extrapolate some ratios; a ratio is a relation between financial or unit data. The goal in this case, is to compare companies between the same industry or the same company in different time frames. That\u2019s defined as \u201cRelative valuation\u201d, relative because it is a comparison. Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.). Time will judge if you made a good choice. It\u2019s always about the allocation of capital. \u201cIf you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings \u2014 assuming the company in question has earnings. As you\u2019ll see in this text, I subscribe to the crusty notion that sooner or later earnings make or break an investment in equities. What the stock price does today, tomorrow, or next week is only a distraction.\u201d Peter Lynch Fig 7. Earnings and capital gain are historically correlated (that\u2019s investing!) As you can see in fig. 6, Lynch\u2019s point is supported by the datas. Like humans, businesses have a life cycle, it\u2019s important to understand where our company stands in its life cycle. Fig 8. Business cycle source: prof Damodaran It\u2019s useful knowing in which stage of its life the company is, in order to better understand the key metrics and what we have to expect the management must do to maximise shareholders returns. This is my semplify thought process through the income statement. Remember that, every industry is different and there are different metrics to focus on, anyway I am trying to summarize the most important factor in the future. I will revisit my analysis of statements with a more granular focus. To be honest, I consider the income statements the least useful of all statements. It\u2019s useful in order to interpret Cash Flow, for example an healthy cash generation depends on increased profits, thanks to income statements we can see the past sales trend. In the Cash flow statement we will see how these sales are converted into real cash. Balance sheet, that is the second statement we will discover! Stay tuned! Warning: All statements represent the past of the company, as investors we need to understand the sustainability of cash generation in the future, in order to do that we need to understand the stories behind our company (11. Stories and numbers) Remember, our goal is to find outstanding business, buy at the right price and hold for the long run. \u201cPut together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years, and so also will the portfolio\u2019s market value.\u201d Warren Buffett Feel free to comment, share my article with friends and subscribe to my newsletter if you like my content and you want to follow me towards financial freedom.

Balance Sheet Analysis Disclaimer: The information contained on this website is for general information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a substitute for legal, commercial and/or financial advice from a licensed professional. Here we go! The first thing to do is recovering the financial statements of the company that we have chosen. A good idea is to choose a company within our circle of competence (10. Circle of competence). What we are going to learn: Read an income statement at a glance Focus on the fundamental numbers Extrapolate some metrics Contextualizing the numbers Email Address The goal is to find the best compounder with a competitive advantage. As in the previous article, I will take, again, Facebook (FB) as an example. The first thing to do is to go on Google and digitize \u201cFB investor relations\u201d. Once we are in the investor page we have to open the last earnings release and search for the Statements of Income. Like I explained in the preceding article (12. Starting Point), there are plenty of platforms that allow us to retrieve the data in a more comfortable set up (e.g. quickfs.net or tikr.com). It is always a good thing to check the datas on official sources like EDGAR. EDGAR is the official SEC (US Security and exchange commission) where we can find official documents on companies. US gov EDGAR The best tool we need for developing quantitative analysis are the Financial statements, remember the past article about stories and numbers. (11. Stories and numbers) \u201cAccounting is the language of business\u201d Warren Buffett When I started my journey in the world of investing, I was afraid about accounting. I started with zero knowledge about this language, but I rapidly noted that not all data is useful. At least, to start, we can have a first idea about a company by looking at a few numbers. If your knowledge about accounting is zero or very minimal, I\u2019ll suggest you to read: \u201cWarren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements: The Search for the Company with a Durable Competitive Advantage\u201d by Mary Buffett Or, if you prefer an educational video: A series of educational videos realized by Prof. Aswath Damoradan (Stern University, NY) Accounting 101 With the following example, I want to analyze with you some useful financial figures, easy to understand even without a CFA. Our aim is to become practitioner investors, not employees of an accounting firm. My goal is to distill the meaningful parts of the process, in order to craft our thesis in a simple manner without too much noise (First principle thinking, remember, when we will talk about Mental models). The final destination is to find companies with strong competitive advantage (14. It\u2019s a war) at a fair price, to buy, hold and let them compound over the long term. \u201cIf the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is almost never.\u201d Phil Fisher Fig.1 Facebook $FB income statement The best is to analyze multiple years of financial, 10 years ideally. In this manner, we can track the number history of the company, and glimpse the evolution over time. In other words, it defines if the company is in healthy condition, and if it is growing overtime. It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses. That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand. Fig.3 World War 2 Coca Cola advertising campaign \u201cTo see that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for 5 cents, wherever he is and whatever it costs the Company.\u201d Robert Woodruff, $KO president, 1923-1954 Fig. 4 Coca Cola\u2019s Santa \u201cBefore 1931, there were many different depictions of Santa Claus around the world, including a tall gaunt man and an elf \u2014 there was even a scary Claus. But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. Those paintings established Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines. Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called \u201cA Visit from St. Nicholas\u201d \u2014 commonly known as \u201cTwas the Night Before Christmas.\u201d www.coca-colacompany.com I\u2019m sorry kids, but your Santa is an advertising experiment, and you are the result of that mind experiment! Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles. Fig. 5 Gross margin profit % Apple vs Xiaomi As we can see in figure 4, Apple gains a lot more cash on the total sales thanks to its globally very known brand. To be honest the two figures (Apple/Xiaiomi profit margin) show the overall company\u2019s margin. To draw a precise figure about the smartphone sector we should decompose the various sectors, but I think this is a sufficient approximation for the purpose of this article. Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales. Now we have our first important metric Gross Margin. There are tons of numbers and metrics useful, but we have only one brain, so the best thing to do is try to cut down our cognitive load. \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Albert Einstein That\u2019s my goal with this blog. Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war).

Article by Warren Buffett promoting value investing, published in the Fall, 1984 issue of Hermes, Columbia Business School magazine. I\u2019ve a confession to say: I\u2019m a Value Investor or at least is what I aim to be.I\u2019m sure a lot of you are wondering about what means to be a Value Investor.To be a Value Investor is counterintuitive because it isn\u2019t in the nature of human beings to behave like a Value Investor.It\u2019s precisely for that reason that it is the right path to follow. Do you remember? In the last article (8. Mr. Market) I spoke about the contrarian attitude of a good investor.It\u2019s very hard to be a contrarian because humans like animals are subjected to herd bias. Why is it so hard to be a contrarian? Because animals in the middle of the herd tend to behave like the other members of the herd, mostly when there is an upcoming threat and little time to think what to do.Under pressure and in the middle of uncertainty we will follow the herd because we believe it\u2019s safer to stay with the crowd. I would say that most of the time this is true, but sometimes the herd reacts in an emotional way through a self-reinforced pattern, because every member follows the next fellow and that generates a chain reaction (bubble, in the case of the stock market. Remember GoPro chart?)Today is a hard time for value investors. With a lot of money flooded in the system, whenever you put your money you will see your capital gain, but untilwhen? Remember, the economy follows cycles, and the winner it\u2019s who is willing to stick with a different path for the long term, it\u2019s who will cope with the entire cycle. Fig 2. Economic Cycles source: Ray Dalio \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked.\u201d Warren Buffett How can we navigate the financial sea in any weather?Simple enough, we must be value investors and behave like a business owner. Like a good captain, we have to choose a great boat with a powerful engine, energy efficiency, and without holes in the shell. But because we don\u2019t have infinite capital, we have to buy at the right price!What does it mean to be a value investor? Or what is value investing?.In the past article I broadly defined the concept when I spoke about the importance of thinking about yourself as a business owner, then like a business owner what it\u2019s important for you are the business performances not what price Mr. Market offers you for your business.As usual, I sum up the question with a quote: \u201cAll intelligent investing is value investing, acquiring more than you are paying for. You must value the business in order to value the stock.\u201d Charlie Munger Over time what counts about a business isn\u2019t the emotional attitude of Mr. Market or the economic cycle. What really matters is how much money the business makes in order to grow, repurchase its own stocks or pay a dividend, the price follows the right path in the long haul. Fig 3. Red line \u2013 stable fundamental growth vs black line \u2013 Mr. Market irrational quotations. I want to highlight two aspects of the value investor attitude: Contarian attitude Patience It requires patience because it can takes time for the market to recognize the value of a company conversely it can takes times for Mr Market to offers you a good business at an interesting price. The father of Value Investing once said: \u201cThe stock investor is neither right or wrong because others agreed or disagreed with him; he is right because his facts and analysis are right.\u201d Benjamin Graham While is the best student added: \u201cThe stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\u201d Warren Buffett In the next article, I will introduce the concept of fundamentals analysis.

Mr Market So far I concentrate my contents on the business and the importance of a good management, now we have to speak about the market price.The stock market is auction based. Roughly speaking; agents that compose the market (institutional investors like pension funds or retail investors like us) offer a price for any security exchanged (for example stocks) on the market.The price depends on the money that any agent is willing to pay to another agent for a given stock (company\u2019s ownership) i.e law of supply and demand.Said that, it is obvious that inside this market there is a lot of human nature, in other words: emotions.Fear, greed, envy, pride, self-esteem are components of human nature that characterise the market auction based dynamics.At this point the situation becomes complicated, because the market can be seen as if it were a person itself, namely Mr Market.The best explanation was stated by Benjamin Graham, father of Value Investing, and revisited by Warren Buffett. \u201cMr. Market is kind of a drunken psycho. Some days he gets very enthused, some days he gets very depressed. And when he gets really enthused you sell to him, and if he gets depressed, you buy from him. There\u2019s no moral taint attached to that.\u201d Warren Buffett For better explain this point I would show you a chart. Fig 2. Tesla (TSLA) stock chart 2019-2020 As you can see, Tesla stock more than quadruples its value in less than 6 months, anyway the fundamentals financial valuation metrics don\u2019t fluctuate in the same way over the short-term. A simple example is the market value of Tesla. At the moment Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is double than Toyota even if Tesla sells an infinitesimal number of cars compared to Toyota.Clearly that isn\u2019t a sufficient analysis, anyway is better to be careful about the stock price skyrocketing.Conversely in the long run, fundamental data of the business and the price we will eventually converge.For that reason you don\u2019t have to focus on the short term fluctuation, if not to take advantage on the discounted price. Your wealth will generate over the long term.What causes that short term fluctuations? As I said early, the stock market has an emotional reaction to any short term news that click bait media throws us.The modern world is full of news, data and information, this because there is always someone making a living thanks to your click on the last news s/he writes.The secret is to concentrate on fundamentals data and not on the latest news on CNBC network, and that\u2019s the goal of my blog.But if you are enthused about Tesla\u2019s chart, I will show another chart that shows you what happens when emotion takes place of rationality. Fig 3. GoPro (GPRO) price chart I can\u2019t predict the future of Tesla. Anyway as you can see, when Mr Market changes its mood, you might lose a good part of your capital. I\u2019ve to quote again the best investor of all time, Warren Buffett: \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d Warren Buffett In other words, if you want to be a good investor you have to be a contrarian. Above all, you have to make decisions based on the facts and not on the emotions, and stock price sometimes represents this collective emotion response. \u201cI\u2019m not emotional about investments. Investing is something where you have to be purely rational and not let emotion affect your decision making \u2013 just the facts.\u201d Bill Ackman \u2013 Pershing Square Capital Remember: any time you buy a stock, somebody sell you this stock. You have to ask yourself: \u201cWhy I think I\u2019m in the right side of the transaction?\u201d Remember that on the other side there will be a professional investor with an IQ of 140, an AI algorithm or even Warren Buffett.In the continuation of my blog, I will explain how to value a business and what kind of traps to avoid during the path.

As I explained in the preceding chapters, businesses use the stock market to finance their activities.Basically there are two ways that companies use for financing themselves: debt and equity.My blog focuses on equity holders or also called shareholders.As shareholders we own a piece of business, while debt holders (bondholders) finance the companies through credits.Usually bondholders, because they are not owners, they are the first allowed to claim their money if the company goes bankrupt. There is a sort of hierarchy of claim where the shareholders are the last allowed to claim their part of the company\u2019s wealth after default.This mechanic put the shareholders in a risky position but even gives us the probability of a better gain.Bondholder return is given and limited while return for shareholders is potentially unlimited.But don\u2019t worry, that risk can be managed and I will explain to you how to do it in future articles.Our objective is to find good companies that pay us back as much as possible.This idea is called \u201cCapital allocation\u201d. Namely find where to put money in order to obtain the maximum return on capital. Returns are essentially divided in 3 main ways: Dividends Buybacks Retained earnings Dividends The most simple and direct method that companies use to share their profits with investors. Dividends are a percentage of the total amount of the capital invested that is pay back monthly or yearly.For example Coke Company pays a dividend of 1.64 USD for every share that in this moment worth approximately 46 USD per share (08 august 2020), this dividend is 3.4% of the total capital you had invested in. Usually this dividend is destined to grow over time. Fig 2. Coke dividend growth Buybacks Another option to share profit is through stocks buybacks.Company buys its own shares in order to reduce the number of circulating shares, doing so investors gain thanks to the rise in percentage owned by the company.For example: if I had a company that was worth 100b and I divided this company into 100 pieces (stocks), every investor owns 1/100 of the company and therefore 1/100 of the profit. But what happens if I remove 10 pieces of this company shares? Now the remaining investors own 1/90 of the company or in other words a bigger piece of the pie.A good management buys back stocks when the market price is below the intrinsic value. What is intrinsic value? I will explain in future articles. Summing up, intrinsic value or fair value, it is the value of the firm based on its intrinsic characteristics. Like the value of a car is based on the horsepower or on the brand\u2019s value.Remember: the value of a company IS NOT the market price.The price is only what the other investors are willing to pay for receiving the ownership of the business. Last but not least point is: Retained earnings Companies keep profit for a lot of tasks.It seems silly that the company doesn\u2019t pay their earnings to us.In reality it is the best option but only if we trust in management competence.If management has good ideas and it knows how to use your money to grow the business, you will gain thanks to organic growth of the business itself (development of a new product) or through smart acquisition (for example when FB acquired Instagram). That growth will increase the pie size and then the value of your ownership, that it will recognised by the market in the future, in others words the stock price will increase. Fig 3. Brands acquisited by Disney thanks to smart capital allocation Another example: Disney is expanding its brand territories by developing a platform, Disney+, to cope with the competitors, and follow the changing users behaviors, from purchasing DVDs to buying streaming services.

He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn\u2019t, pays it.\u201d Attributed to Albert Einstein The concept behind the compound interest is very simple.Imagine you have a bank account that earn you an annual interest of 4% (it is an utopias today), if you put 1000USD in your bank account the 1 january of the year, at the end of the year your account gain is 40USD (1000*0.04), hence you will start the new year with 1040USD on your account. If the next year the bank will give you another 4% interest rate and you don\u2019t withdraw money at the end of the year, you will end with the initial amount of 1040USD plus interest, but this time the interest would be 4% of 1040USD that will be 41.6USD for a total of 1081.6 in year two.This pattern will be followed for the following years and it will become exponential. Below you can see the result after 30 years of compounding for only 1000USD at 4% yearly without further deposits. Fig 1. Compound interest 1000usd 30 years later at 4% You can test the potential of this concept through the link below: Compound interest calculator US gov As investors this becomes relevant, because our goal is to find businesses that compound their capital, consequently our wealth far above 4%.Personally I look for companies that compound 15%+.

What is the difference? Stock market is composed by many companies that produce a broad range of products and services. These companies together make the basement of the country productivity.Because the world follows a growing path in terms of circulating money, number of citizens and consequently numbers of products and services, if we add up the value of all the national company or from a specific sector, and we buy a piece of that collection, over time we will gain thanks to the growth of the worldwide Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Fig. 1 source Federal Reserve As you can see in the US the circulating money is growing and that money goes into the pockets of those who invest. For example, I often heard people complaining about riches. The difference between poor and rich is that the riches take assets through the investing practice, while poors take liabilities because they spend all their income for short-term futile purpose. With passive investing method you can buy through a fund a piece of a sector, a country or even the entire world and partecipate in the wealth growing. An example is S&P500. Fig. 2 source Wikipedia This is a bouquet of the 500 largest US companies, in finance this instrument is called \u201can index\u201d, specifically in this case is called Index Fund. For the 10 years ending December 31st 2019, had an annual compounded rate of return of 13.2%, including reinvestment of dividends. Fig. 3 Compound interest on last 10 years of S&P500 on a initial investment of 10000 USD to 34000 USD As you can see in the long run the growth of the Index follows the path of the growth of the circulating money. S&P500 is only an example, there is plenty of index for every nation or sector. Exchange Traded Fund Today we have specific financial instruments that mimic the trend of the various indexes. This instrument is called Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). ETFs are exchange like stocks and the main issuer of this instrument are Vanguard or iShare.An example is SPY, if you have a bank account you can ask your consultant about this option. Fig 4 Main components of S&P500 (SPY) Source Yahoo finance If you follow this path, you don\u2019t have to worry about the soundness of a single company where you invest, because you invest in the entire market.

Yes, we are what we are today because of a series of improvements obtained thanks to some biological adaptations, mainly caused by genes but not only. It seems indeed that the best tool we have gained through evolutionary processes is mainly the consequence of our ability to handle food, our cerebral cortex growth was exponential when we discovered how to cook and conserve food, this gives us regularity in our meals and the ability to feed ourselves in tranches of more digestible food instead of having irregular big meals of raw food.

Ok Dave but this shit is tasty! Our perception of good or bad, beauty or ugliness, good taste or bad taste is highly dependent on our culture. If you grow up in an environment where sauces, sugars drinks, and low quality beef between two pieces of low quality bread are highly advertised, all your friends eat Mcdonalds too, and therefore most of your childhood memories are tied to a Fast Food, you will probably associate fast food as one your best experiences. Having a healthy lifestyle requires effort and the willingness to recalibrate our taste buds, in other words align our concept of tasty with the brick of a healthy diet. Most of us are addicted to sensory perceptions, like for example the sweet taste which does not exist in a natural environment but the industry energizing in order to enslave us to inexistent taste, investing the money distorting our short term brain sensations at the expense of the nutritional contents for long term health consequences.

What I immediately understand is the importance of testosterone and growth hormone e their response to various type of food: Testosterone This hormone is incredibly important for the body composition but not only, it is also for our mind giving you more energy and more focus, it seems also that it positively affects memory. Optimizing its productions seems like a good idea. It seems again that the foods we introduce in our body mainly affects our cognitive skills. A part of our testosterone is converted into estradiol (an estrogen steroid hormone, the major female sex hormone) by a process called aromatase. Body fat levels increase the amount of testosterone converted, and therefore if our goal is to optimize the production of these hormones, then a low level of body fat is required. On the other hand though, as our body uses fat to metabolize testosterone, then it is important to have a balanced amount of fat in our diet, removing fats from our diets is a common mistake in this sense.

Fasting is a homeostatic effort which improves our antifragile system (antifragility article), as the phoenix has to die in order to rebirth even stronger. During fasting your body will give you signals of surrender, as is always the case when homeostasis is tested, but if you survive from a psychological standpoint you will rebirth stronger. Warning: educate yourself about the importance of electrolytes and risks tied to fasting before starting this practice, tell your intentions to your doctor and understand that fasting will test your body which will surely rebel against your decision to deprive it of food.

Sometimes even defined by Graham as \u201ccigar butt\u201d, heavily discounted companies in regard to their tangible assets at the point that the value of the assets itself was greater than the price of the security. Then in a liquidation event (bankruptcy), the investor would have received back the proceeds of the fire sale (only after bondholders). Today, especially in the developed market, we rely on services and technologies which are asset-light businesses. What does the switch from asset heavy to asset light means? Book value (the value of the assets found on the balance sheet) are less valuable in respect to the past. Today we have companies with a high barrier to entry, a powerful brand with mindshare and strong network effects, which produce high profit with less assets.

The logic behind is better explained by a simple example. Imagine you built a lemonade stand near a beautiful beach in some exotic country. As we have seen in the last article a business has some costs related to the activity. Some of this depends directly on the production of the lemon juice (COGS) for example the lemon itself, but even commodities such as the sugar. Then you have to pay the stand where you produce the drink, the land where your activity stands, the machinery to squeeze the lemons. What you will gain depends on how much lemon juice you sell (Revenue), how much you pay to your supplier for the commodities you use in order to manufacture the product (lemon, sugar), how much you will pay to buy/rent the land where your juice factory stands, and how much it will cost to then buy and replace the squeeze machinery (depreciation). In the end, your profit depends if customers come to your stand or to a competitor one. Then, you have to have good marketing to build a brand (mindshare) and good relations with your supplier, maybe thanks to economies of scale, and thus get the lemon for a better price than",

This is a simplified summary of what we had seen until now. \u201cWhy Stocks Go Up and Down\u201d by William H. Pike is a great book to deepen the subject (Books) Now, what if you want to sell the ownership of the lemonade international enterprise? At what price do you sell it? Or, in our case as value investors, at what price will we buy it? Note: A Moat is imperative to ensure the realization of the future cash flow, the Moat is what gives us some degree of certainty about the future cash. Without a competitive advantage our margin is threatened and the future cash flow with it. (14. It\u2019s a War) For that reason, this blog isn\u2019t just about a simple formula, but the formula we discovered today is only a piece of the grand scheme of things. As explained by Buffett \u201c [\u2026] the formula for valuing all assets that are purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out by a very smart man in about 600 B.C. (though he wasn\u2019t smart enough to know it was 600 B.C.). The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete, investment",

How certain are you that there are indeed birds in the bush? When will they emerge and how many will there be? What is the risk-free interest rate (which we consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)? If you can answer these three questions, you will know the maximum value of the bush\u2014 and the maximum number of the birds you now possess that should be offered for it. And, of course, don\u2019t literally think of birds. Think dollars.\u201d Warren Buffett Buffett\u2019s quote implied a series of notion: Time Value of Money = a sum of money in the hand as a greater value than the same sum to be paid in the future. The implied uncertainty of the future discounts the value of tomorrow\u2019s money. Opportunity cost = a more compelling opportunity arises, for example a company with a better price, or more simply, the business you are currently valuing doesn\u2019t grant you a good rate of return in the next few years, maybe because the price is too high, then a US treasury (known for its absence of risks = risk free) is a better alternative.

There are some notorious investors, for example, which they mentally do this calculation or some others which use some shortcut like for example P/E or EV/EBIT. These metrics are named as relative valuation tools, because they are used to compare different investments. Relative valuation looks more simple at glance, the trick is that in these simplified relationships between financial numbers you imply some underlying numbers without clearly expressing them. We will see in the Python code the number of assumptions we have to define in order to obtain the intrinsic value. As we know, the future is inherently uncertain, then every assumption is an error node in our process to reach the range of possible intrinsic value. Mauboussin suggests that given that the stock price is known, we can use a reverse DCF, reversing it to understand what assumptions the market implies in the stock price and if our assumptions are more or less optimistic. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, instead, is part of the tools named Absolute valuation. What\u2019s the difference? As I explained, the risk free rate used as a comparative hurdle in order to discount the cash flow is highly dependable by the US Treasury.

In other words, people shop at Costco because it is Costco, not because Costco stocks Coke. And the reason they shop is that goods are priced at a fixed maximum 14% mark up over cost. Costco must ensure that: (1) Operating costs are low, indeed very low.

I see a natural trend that is resource rationalization. We follow that line since the beginning of the species, there is some volatility, but the millennial trend is here to stay. We are more and more on this planet, we must become more and more able to optimize our space, even building new dimensions (metaverse) or discovering new ones (space).

The cash flow statement recognizes the transaction when the money is transferred. This absence of further manipulation, sometimes, defines a more honest picture of the business, for that reason I particularly like this statement, and it\u2019s a good idea to always reason in terms of Cash in and Cash out.

The energy generation of an engine depends on the efficiency of the system, indeed electric motors are more energy saving, than internal combustion engines (ICE). The latter are also known as heath engines. In thermodynamics, a heat engine is a system that converts heat to mechanical energy, as is the case for the ICE because this engine work by burning fuels to release heat through chemical reactions and eventually producing mechanical thrust. But,what does financial statements have to do with thermodynamics? Because we are going to search for the engine with less energetic dispersion, in other words, the more efficient company.

Operational Cash Flow represents the cash generated by the company business operation, in this sense in my opinion is the most important part of the statement. The Cash Flow Statement has another advantage respect to the income statement, since it is an honest representation of the cash generated by the company in a given period it leave out non-cash expenses (e.g D&A Depreciation and Amortization, SBC Stock based compensation) and some gain unrelated to the operation of the business, as is the case for the gain of the marketable securities investments.

So far, I have spoken highly about buybacks (Berkshire Hathaway is good example), indeed I think share repurchase is a useful tool in order to reward shareholders, but you have to dig about the balance between share issuances and share repurchase in order to understand if there is a real gain for us, or only an escamotage, adding back SBC to OCF could be a viable alternative. \u201cTo say \u201cStock-Based Compensation\u201d is not an expense is even more cavalier.

This energy has been converted into one of the most notorious and valuable fictional characters of all time, imagine how much money $DIS extrapolate from this creative work (e.g., comics, books, parks, merchandising,\u2026). \u201cin 1966 people said \u201cWell, Mary Poppins is terrific this year, but they [Disney] are not going to have another Mary Poppins next year, so the earnings will be down.\u201d I don\u2019t care if the earnings are down like that. You know you\u2019ve still got Mary Poppins to throw out in seven more years, assuming kids squawk a little. I mean there\u2019s no better system than to have something where, essentially, you get a new crop every seven years and you get to charge more each time.\u201d Warren Buffett We all know how many cash crops Disney made over the last 70 years thanks to the large number of characters owned by the company. Intellectual properties could be an eternal money mine with the difference that a mine needs physical infrastructures which in turns needs maintenance, Mickey not.

Consequently it is better to have a quick turnover cycle depending on the industry. Inventory turnover: COGS / Average inventory.

Debt is useful and its scope is to generate wealth in our society. A good starting point in order to understand the role of debt is a video made by Ray Dalio (How economic machine works). However, debt is a social problem. When an individual, a business or a society brings more debt than is productive output, there could be a problem (unless you are the reserve currency printer, namely US, but this is another story \u2013 Lyn Alden Petrodollar).

For example, having a huge pile of debts and paying high dividends to the shareholders may seem a good idea, but in reality is the sign of a myopic management with a short term vision. High level of debt means high level of interest to pay, this interest will reduce the cash our business can pay to us as owners, moreover this debt burden must be rapaid sooner or later, reducing future cash generation.

In other words, it is the action of a short-sighted management and it will be detrimental for long term shareholders. It is useful to compare cash and long term debt in order to understand how much net debt the company has. Why do some companies have cash and debt? There are many reasons. The first reason is the tax advantage. Another reason worth noting is that some companies are international, then they have assets in foreign currency exposed to local devaluation risks to compensate for this devaluation the company takes a debt in the same currency, in order to take advantage of local currency devaluation without trapping money in countries with weak currency. Leases Lease is a contract between two parties, where the lessee pays the lessors for an asset use. Be careful, capital leases are counted as liabilities. A new FASB rule, effective Dec. 15, 2018, requires that all leases unless they are shorter than 12 months must be recognized on the balance sheet. Number of common stock We have already discussed the notion of share repurchases (how companies reward us).

On the other hand the management could pay itself and the employer with stocks (Stock Based Compensation). Nothing wrong about it, if employees and management are themselves owners could mean that they act like owners in the interest of us, as investors. This is a complex argument that needs a separate article, but it is worth remembering for the next article where we are going to analyze the cash flow. Other than that it is good to look at the number of share counts over time in order to understand if the company is diluting our earning participation. The management must treat shares as if they are gold bullions, nothing wrong using stock as a currency, but only if the exchange is worth our gold bullions.

Past data are useful to understand the management ability, but they are not certainties for future returns. \u201cIn the business world, unfortunately, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the windshield.\u201d Warren Buffett This means two things: The art of investing is the ability to use past numbers and stories to help us to hypothesize the existence of a MOAT, and the ability of the management to defend and improve this MOAT over time. That is the secret to maintaining the past performances. We, as investors, use this data and our future outlook to choose the investment with the best probabilistic chance to realize a gain. For that reason I\u2019m obsessed with the idea of finding companies with a wide competitive advantage. The past uses of capital is a responsibility of the management and condition of the past. It is entirely possible that the recent Capital Allocation has become better or worse, but our metrics pay the price of past weak decisions (e.g., if management in the past overpay for an asset, this excess can weigh on the balance sheet). Ideally, we want to assess the present capital allocation decision, but almost always, we have the data of the entire asset\u2019s story of the business, and we can\u2019t assess the Return of Capital for every single project.

It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings).

If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient.

Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell.

For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations,",

From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors.

Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock.

Initially, the goal of those studies is to explore events that give us a hint about a particular notion, analyzed during the main course. In the future, I will write a whole analysis of stocks that are under my radar or in my portfolio. In this case, I\u2019ll refer to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s share repurchase in the last quarter. Berkshire Hathaway $BRK is the company whose chairman is the known Warren Buffett. $BRK is a holding, in other words, it\u2019s a company that owns other companies. The work of Buffett as chairman and Munger as vice-chairman is to allocate the capital generated by the holding towards subsidiaries and sometimes acquiring whole private companies or slices of businesses in the stock market.

Buffett careful does buybacks only when the price of $BRK is below its intrinsic value (Intrinsic value: notion we just started to learn in the blog but about we will go deeper in the future, ELI5 Intrinsic value or fair value is the price you should pay for a company from a business perspective, in respect of its future earnings). Well, what happened in the last quarter? Berkshire decided to repurchase its own shares for an amount of 9 Billion dollars, already in the previous quarter, Buffett repurchased 5.1 Billion. Since the start of the Covid-19 crisis that crashed the market, Buffett gave to $BRK shareholders a total of 14.1 Billion. I have to say that I\u2019m a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and this decision make me happy for two reasons: 1) Buffett felt that BRK was undervalued, this means that I bought BRK at a fair price. Basically, my evaluation was right from Buffett\u2019s perspective. 2) The price of BRK rises propelled by share repurchase, therefore my wealth grows. Fig",

An important lesson we can extrapolate from this event: A good company uses his money to invest in his own business when Mr Market (8. Mr Market) throws good prices. But the most important point is the balance sheet of the company. In other words a lot of cash and low debt, in this way, when the crisis comes, management can take the opportunities that arise from. \u201cIn the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity\u201d Sun Tzu Not every management repurchases shares in the best moment, often managers repurchase shares when the price is very high. In periods of widespread optimism, many managers in order to please shareholders and to exercise their options (Management stock options: we will return on this point, ELI5: benefits to management if stocks reach a certain price) they do buybacks in the worst period, when the stock price is overvalued. Fig.3 Boeing ($BA) shares rep and debt pile Fig.4 Boeing ($BA) stock price Those two images are enough to explain what goes wrong with Boeing. Managers repurchase shares when the price was high, moreover, they do buybacks while piling a lot of debt, instead of doing that with cash produced by the business itself (Free cash flow).

Speculators buy stocks waiting for another buyer who pays more and they gain thanks to the difference, an investor instead buys a business and his gain depends on the quality of the management and the cash generated by the business itself. The former hopes to find a buyer, sometimes only more fools than him. The latter invests in the business for the long run and gains because of the business itself not for the willingness of other speculators to pay more for the same piece of paper.

The main goal of qualitative analysis (stories) is to understand the business\u2019s side that it can\u2019t be quantified in numbers terms. For example, understand how the persons behind the decision are, make an inquiry about the CEO. Who is? From where s/he came from? What did s/he do in the past?

A competitive advantage allows the firm to survive and become stronger over time. Warren Buffett defined the competitive advantage of a company as the moat of a castle, a series of intrinsic attributes of a business that defend it by the outside attacks from other businesses that want to gain our customers and our market share, for example, Pepsi Vs. Coca Cola, Apple Vs. Samsung, and so on. Fig.2 Moat Investing is a craft.

Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, owes some of his fortunes to Coke (KO). He invests a lot of money in it, and he becomes rich even thanks to this soft drink brand. The interesting side of this story is that he started his love story with the brand when he was young. When he was a child he collected a refund from recycled Coke bottles. Over time he never lost his passion about the brand. He bought his first share in 1988. Then he never sold, instead he bought more over time, when Mr. Market (article 8. Mr. Market) gives him opportunities to buy at a low price. \u201cOf a certainty, it was in 1936 that I started buying Cokes at the rate of six for 25 cents from Buffett & Son, the family grocery store, to sell around the neighborhood for 5 cents each. In this excursion into high-margin retailing, I duly observed the extraordinary consumer attractiveness and commercial possibilities of the product. I continued to note these qualities for the next 52 years as Coke blanketed the world. Only in the summer of 1988 did my brain finally establish contact with my eyes\u2026What was already the world\u2019s most ubiquitous product gained new momentum, with sales",

As you can read in the \u201cMr. Market\u201d article, sometimes the agents that make up the market follow an irrational behavior.Tesla (TSLA) for example in one week lost over 30% of its market value. While in the last six months, the market value has grown by 700%. Be Rational! We have to be careful, here isn\u2019t a rational attitude behind those movements. Moreover, these movements are so fast and violent.When people invest and follow the momentum caused by the herd instead of a rational cognitive process, the risk of losing our mind is high.When the price goes up the classic thought is: \u201cI\u2019m missing the chance of my life to become rich, buy a boat and have a Bilzerian\u2019s lifestyle\u201d.

Remember: we are a species of evolved human beings namely Value Investors, our decisions are based on data processing, not animal instincts.I leave you with the first tool of fundamental analysis, which is one of the most known metrics in the financial world and it is the Price to earnings ratio (P/E).I must specify that P/E is only one of the metrics used in finance but in this context, it\u2019s worth writing about it.The equation behind P/E is simply Price divided by Earnings.Price is the market quotation while earnings are the net income of the company. You can use the total market capitalization (share price*number of share outstanding) divided by total earnings (most publicized company\u2019s data), or simply by divided share price for earnings per share (EPS).You can find this data on finance.yahoo.com, usually, P/E is already calculated and shows as one of the first data.Metrics and ratios are used in the field of a relative quotation, namely allowing you to compare at a glance various companies in the",

But, even it\u2019s true, be careful when the price of a company is tied more (or even just) to the future than to the present, mostly when you pay a price 1000 times the earnings.The future is always uncertain.

Life, economy, business. The economy follows a cyclical pattern, the same is true for human life and business life but we will dig deeper into business life when we will talk about valuation. Economic cycles are mainly defined by the relation between credits and debts. The best explanation on this matter was published by Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Hedge Fund.If you want a more comprehensive description I invite you to watch his video lesson on youtube How the economic machine works.I think is important to understand the basics of how the economic machine works in order to be a good investor. Time Value. Basically a debt is an agreement between two parts that money given today (principal) will be repaid in the future with a premium (interest). It\u2019s obvious that if I give you a sum of money I expect to be paid for the time that my money is in your hand.In other words, with this money I can do various things that give me a return, then if I decide to give you this money, I lose the opportunity to invest in other things that could have a return. This is called the time value of money and it is one of the most fundamental notions in finance. The power of debt. Meanwhile, you have my money, you can use this money to generate a profit greater than the interests you will pay to me. Typically",

They can lend money to other individuals (households debt) or corporations (corporate bonds). Government and state also are in debt. The principle doesn\u2019t change.All those entities ideally borrow money with the goal to create more wealth in the future in order to repay the principal plus interest and make the gain. The best example to describe those dynamics is a simple business like a farm. Imagine that a farmer has already a land, paid with his own money. Now he wants to sow wheat but he doesn\u2019t have a tractor, the farmer has 2 choices: saving for months until he can buy the tractor or take a loan and buying the tractor now, this means earn already now. An obvious part of future gains will be utilized to repay the principal and to pay interest, but if he does the math he can earn more and he will develop his business.I have deliberately left out debts related to private consumption like a new TV, new car, new tablet because is not a matter of this blog and I think is a stupid use of this instrument.Instead of getting into debt to buy useless stuff, learn the art of saving. \u201cDo not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving.\u201d Warren Buffett This mechanism creates the economic cycle, the time where we get into debts and we grow and time where we have to pay back this debt then our spending capacity",

Do you remember? In the last article (8. Mr. Market) I spoke about the contrarian attitude of a good investor.It\u2019s very hard to be a contrarian because humans like animals are subjected to herd bias. Why is it so hard to be a contrarian? Because animals in the middle of the herd tend to behave like the other members of the herd, mostly when there is an upcoming threat and little time to think what to do.Under pressure and in the middle of uncertainty we will follow the herd because we believe it\u2019s safer to stay with the crowd. I would say that most of the time this is true, but sometimes the herd reacts in an emotional way through a self-reinforced pattern, because every member follows the next fellow and that generates a chain reaction (bubble, in the case of the stock market. Remember GoPro chart?)Today is a hard time for value investors. With a lot of money flooded in the system, whenever you put your money you will see your capital gain, but untilwhen?

Your wealth will generate over the long term.What causes that short term fluctuations? As I said early, the stock market has an emotional reaction to any short term news that click bait media throws us.The modern world is full of news, data and information, this because there is always someone making a living thanks to your click on the last news s/he writes.The secret is to concentrate on fundamentals data and not on the latest news on CNBC network, and that\u2019s the goal of my blog.But if you are enthused about Tesla\u2019s chart, I will show another chart that shows you what happens when emotion takes place of rationality.

As I explained in the preceding chapters, businesses use the stock market to finance their activities.Basically there are two ways that companies use for financing themselves: debt and equity.My blog focuses on equity holders or also called shareholders.As shareholders we own a piece of business, while debt holders (bondholders) finance the companies through credits.Usually bondholders, because they are not owners, they are the first allowed to claim their money if the company goes bankrupt. There is a sort of hierarchy of claim where the shareholders are the last allowed to claim their part of the company\u2019s wealth after default.This mechanic put the shareholders in a risky position but even gives us the probability of a better gain.Bondholder return is given and limited while return for shareholders is potentially unlimited.But don\u2019t worry, that risk can be managed and I will explain to you how to do it in future articles.Our objective is to find good companies that pay us back as much as possible.This idea is called \u201cCapital allocation\u201d. Namely find where to put money in order to obtain the maximum return on capital. Returns are essentially divided in 3 main ways: Dividends Buybacks Retained earnings Dividends The most simple and direct method that companies use to share their profits with investors. Dividends are a percentage of the total amount of the capital invested that is pay back monthly or yearly.For example Coke Company pays a dividend of 1.64 USD for every share that in this moment worth approximately 46 USD per share (08 august",

Coke dividend growth Buybacks Another option to share profit is through stocks buybacks.Company buys its own shares in order to reduce the number of circulating shares, doing so investors gain thanks to the rise in percentage owned by the company.For example: if I had a company that was worth 100b and I divided this company into 100 pieces (stocks), every investor owns 1/100 of the company and therefore 1/100 of the profit. But what happens if I remove 10 pieces of this company shares? Now the remaining investors own 1/90 of the company or in other words a bigger piece of the pie.A good management buys back stocks when the market price is below the intrinsic value. What is intrinsic value? I will explain in future articles. Summing up, intrinsic value or fair value, it is the value of the firm based on its intrinsic characteristics. Like the value of a car is based on the horsepower or on the brand\u2019s value.Remember: the value of a company IS NOT the market price.The price is only what the other investors are willing to pay for receiving the ownership of the business.

            "text": "Attributed to Albert Einstein The concept behind the compound interest is very simple.Imagine you have a bank account that earn you an annual interest of 4% (it is an utopias today), if you put 1000USD in your bank account the 1 january of the year, at the end of the year your account gain is 40USD (1000*0.04), hence you will start the new year with 1040USD on your account. If the next year the bank will give you another 4% interest rate and you don\u2019t withdraw money at the end of the year, you will end with the initial amount of 1040USD plus interest, but this time the interest would be 4% of 1040USD that will be 41.6USD for a total of 1081.6 in year two.This pattern will be followed for the following years and it will become exponential. Below you can see the result after 30 years of compounding for only 1000USD at 4% yearly without further deposits. Fig 1. Compound interest 1000usd 30 years later at 4% You can test the potential of this concept through the link below: Compound interest calculator US gov As investors this becomes relevant, because our goal is to find businesses that compound their capital, consequently our wealth far above 4%.Personally I look for companies that compound 15%+.

If there is a lot more money, this money loses value. Fig 1. US Dollars debasement What does it mean for those who don\u2019t invest?

What is the difference? Stock market is composed by many companies that produce a broad range of products and services. These companies together make the basement of the country productivity.Because the world follows a growing path in terms of circulating money, number of citizens and consequently numbers of products and services, if we add up the value of all the national company or from a specific sector, and we buy a piece of that collection, over time we will gain thanks to the growth of the worldwide Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Fig. 1 source Federal Reserve As you can see in the US the circulating money is growing and that money goes into the pockets of those who invest. For example, I often heard people complaining about riches. The difference between poor and rich is that the riches take assets through the investing practice, while poors take liabilities because they spend all their income for short-term futile purpose.

A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing",

If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales). In marketing this is named Mindshare, that is the amount of consumer awareness or popularity surrounding a particular product or brand.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

Fig. 6 gross margins Ferrari vs Toyota Gross margin % tells us even if a company can absorb the systemic crises that sometimes occur in the broad economy. If a product is really needed by the population, people are willing to buy it even in the middle of a crisis, even if there is a liquidity crisis and the people have less money in their pockets. The notion of \u201cneed a product\u201d doesn\u2019t mean exclusively that people can\u2019t physically live without, but could mean that their mental well-being depends on this specific object, this because marketers are doing well in the task to manipulate future customer brains to the point that in a crisis they need a branded product (Remember who brings the gifts at Christmas?). Thanks to these mechanics, the company is able to maintain the same price or even higher, and, in the meantime, it is able to sustain the same degree of sales.

Another important line in the statement is Research and Developments (R&D), which includes the costs of the activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war). Net income is the bottom line on the income statement, it represents what remains after all expenses are subtracted. Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company. It is useful to compare the trend, the numbers and the relations between SG&A and other figures like revenue, for example the % of SG&A compared to revenue in the past years.

The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested.

Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner.

Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield.

Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time.

In this manner, we can track the number history of the company, and glimpse the evolution over time. In other words, it defines if the company is in healthy condition, and if it is growing overtime. It is good to remember that at the end of the day we have to mix numbers with stories and the two things have to fit each other. Stories give sense to numbers and to the prospects of the business. Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset.

That point is going to be recalled when we will calculate a range of prices for our company. Look at the top line! Top line is a jargon that refers to the top number of the income statements. If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs).

Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business. For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple.

Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

Retaking the precedent allegory about fuel, net income is the results after the combustion, the useful energy left and hopefully transferred to the shareholders. As usual we are prone to find good management, a good management doesn\u2019t use our cash in lavish manner, rather it strives to be frugal, this attitude can be seen through the Selling General & Admin Expenses (SG&A). SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company.

The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins. What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future.

Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time.

Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors.

That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition.

Fig 2. Income statement 10yr source: TIKR Income statement is the first statement we are going to analyze. It is also known as a profit and loss statement (P&L). It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses.

Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money? The best company where we invest our money is a company which doesn\u2019t really need our money, in other words it\u2019s financially self-sufficient. As owners, we receive money from it and not stoking the fire with our cash. We want a cash machine not a money burner! What defines the profitability of the company? Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business.

Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing.

A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment). To be fair, there are some other types of competitive advantage that we will analyze in next articles.

R&D defines how much the company has to pay to remain competitive in his industry, typically tech companies have to spend a lot of money in order to develop new products and retain customers. Some industries are heavily technologically competitive, so the company has to constantly innovate in order to maintain the advantage or to gain it (14.it\u2019s a war).

SG&A tells us the costs incurred managing the company.

What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.

In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner.

Remember that, every industry is different and there are different metrics to focus on, anyway I am trying to summarize the most important factor in the future.

Debt is useful and its scope is to generate wealth in our society. A good starting point in order to understand the role of debt is a video made by Ray Dalio (How economic machine works).

For example, having a huge pile of debts and paying high dividends to the shareholders may seem a good idea, but in reality is the sign of a myopic management with a short term vision.

In other words, it is the action of a short-sighted management and it will be detrimental for long term shareholders. It is useful to compare cash and long term debt in order to understand how much net debt the company has. Why do some companies have cash and debt? There are many reasons. The first reason is the tax advantage. Another reason worth noting is that some companies are international, then they have assets in foreign currency exposed to local devaluation risks to compensate for this devaluation the company takes a debt in the same currency, in order to take advantage of local currency devaluation without trapping money in countries with weak currency. Leases Lease is a contract between two parties, where the lessee pays the lessors for an asset use. Be careful, capital leases are counted as liabilities.

On the other hand the management could pay itself and the employer with stocks (Stock Based Compensation). Nothing wrong about it, if employees and management are themselves owners could mean that they act like owners in the interest of us, as investors. This is a complex argument that needs a separate article, but it is worth remembering for the next article where we are going to analyze the cash flow. Other than that it is good to look at the number of share counts over time in order to understand if the company is diluting our earning participation.

If you look at the fig.1 you can see the Revenue, and that is the raw fuel of the company. Why raw? Because the real fuel has to be processed, there is a lot of work the company has to do in order to generate profit. It has to deduct the cost of its work to obtain the gain that belongs to us, as the owners. But the fuel of our company is not our money?

Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs).

For example: marketing, R&D (research for developing new products), cash for acquiring other business to consolidate the position as market leader, etc. This deduction will come in the following lines of the statement. Anyhow the gross profit already tells us a lot of stuff about the company. (Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products.

Pricing power is even more important when inflation comes, because it permits to transfer the increase in price (raw material + labor) to customers and to increase shareholders value, thus protecting owners wealth. Usually price power is developed through marketing, in this statement we can see how much the company spends for marketing. A brand when created through marketing it becomes an intangible asset, an asset that can become stronger over time and doesn\u2019t need maintenance, thus when inflation comes this asset generates cash without reinvestment needs (which would be high in a inflationary environment).

What makes the difference is the cash returned over the cost to financing our engine, in other words, the return of capital. The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested.

The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements.

From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is 3.3%, not too much. But FB is poised to grow fast in the future then you must add the growth rate to the equation. If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator.

That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill. Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock.

It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses.

Revenue obviously, but above all the qualities of those revenue. They depend on the efficiency of the company. A good company led by a good management will generate cash with low friction (costs). The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell.

(Revenue-COGS)/Revenue gives the % margin of gross profit, that is how much profit from sales we retain. What we are looking for are companies that increase the % of profit that it can retain. Every sector of the economy has a different margin because, for example, a steel company has a lot to pay for raw material than a software company that is service oriented. Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing.

The difference between how much the company pays for the capital and the cash returned, it\u2019s what we retain as owners. What does it mean? Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece",

How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and that is important to understand how the company finances its share repurchase (e.g., debt when the company is already over levered or free cash flow. The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable.

Assets write-down or write-off: that happens when a company must reduce partially or totally the value of an asset, that\u2019s because for some reasons it loses value over time. It is often used to account for unpaid loans, unpaid receivables (debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered) or losses on inventory value. Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign. Good companies have a good capital allocator as CEO, then they do few or none impairments, the management works as you when deciding to buy or not a stock. Perhaps, you will pay a premium over the value of the company\u2019s stock you are willing to buy, that\u2019s because you see an hidden or intangible value in the company (e.g., astonishing future growth, brand awareness, etc.).

It tells us what is going on in the company in terms of revenue, and how this revenue gets transformed into profits during a particular period. Income statement provides information on the revenues and expenses of the firm, and the resulting income made by the firm, during a timeframe. Including non-cash expense as: Amortization = Expensing the cost of intangible assets (brand, intellectual property, patents, copyright, trademarks,\u2026) over the projected life of the asset. Depreciation = the same of Amortization, but with tangible assets (computers, office furniture, trucks, buildings). These are defined non-cash expenses, because the cash costs are already deducted from Cash Flow in full when the item was purchased and immediately represented in the Cash Flow Statement (Cash accounting). The current cost represented in the income statement is the spreading of the cost incurred over the useful life of the asset (Accrual Accounting), thus defined as non-cash expenses.

The first place to look is COGS (Cost Of Good Sold), namely how much we have to pay for the materials needed to assemble the products/services we are going to sell. When we subtract COGS from revenue we obtain gross profit. Why gross? Because our engine (company) takes energy (cash) to develop the business.

Businesses with high scalability have high gross margins, because every addicted unit of product doesn\u2019t add any fixed cost. Software industry is a great example. Gross margin tells us whether if a business has a competitive advantage, particularly if the product or service delivered is sufficiently needed by customers that they are willing to pay over the price to get the product (Pricing power), however a company could have price power from the supply side. If the company is a big customer of a supplier, can bargain with him in order to obtain discounts on raw material or manufactured products, that depends on the scale. A good example is Apple. Apple has a strong brand so people are willing to pay a high price for an iPhone despite the fact other companies sell way cheaper comparable products. Other than that, Apple is the main customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (Semis foundry), which should give to Apple bargaining power in terms of pricing. Without pricing power, competitors will enter the markets and those would easily steal customers only by lowering the price, in this environment nobody will have an advantage then the gain on the product would be eroded. That is for the joy of the customers but not for the owners of the company (e.g. price discounts to improve sales).

Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs.

If the machine works proficiently the money will be transferred to shareholders in a predictable way, like the coupons of a bond.

Relative valuation is opposed to Absolute valuation that refers exclusively to the current data of the company we are analyzing. Absolute valuation is the main path we are going to use in order to define the fair value to pay for our business, that will be the topic of a more in depth analysis during the course of this blog. The most useful metrics, based on what we have learn until now, are the following: Price (market capitalization) / Sales (revenue) = P/S [(Sales \u2013 Cost Of Good Sold) / Sales]*100 = % Gross profit It\u2019s a good sign whether the company grows its sales and its gross profit, despite what most people think, isn\u2019t necessarily an astonishing growth, even a modest growth is sufficient, as long as it is accompanied by growing profit margins.

Money isn\u2019t free (even if we are in a free money environment, zero interest rate), the company has to pay to borrow money and has to return capital to shareholders in order to receive their money (that is what we expect as owners). Then the return from the money received has to be higher than the cost (the company has to pay to obtain this money), otherwise the company is burning money and we are going to lose the money we have invested. Remember: investing is about the future not the past, a good trend tells us that the management has done a good job in the past, but what counts are the stories about the future. Another useful, but sometimes overemphasised metrics, is EPS Earnings per shares, i.e. Net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS is the main Wall Street figure when it comes to value a business. Analysts are always prone to predict EPS quarter by quarter (for us, as value investors, a quarter data set is meaningless, we invest for the long run). It is entirely possible for EPS growth, even if revenues are stagnant or in decline, because the management can work to improve gross margins or profits margins. The second piece of the puzzle are buybacks (7. How the companies reward us), if a company does buyback, the count of share on outstanding decrease, consequently the quantity of earnings for a single share increase, this can be a good sign or not, depend if the buyback happen when the stock are undervalued, and",

The former is financial engineering, the latter is value creation! ). In the future, we will be able to define a range of price for our company, then we are in the position to value if management does buyback in a constructive manner. As you can see, a positive trend in EPS can be both a positive or negative sign, for that reason our financial analysis must include the other two statements. Anyhow, generally speaking, our stock return is tied to earnings growth over time. Price to Earnings P/E, this metric suggests how much we are paying for a slice of the company earn (Case Study 1 \u2013 Tesla (TSLA)). It is obtained dividing Market Capitalization (share price * share outstanding) by the Net income (Earnings). Or in the case you use the price of the single share, you divide the price for the EPS. Because earnings are subject to variations, it is often more useful reasoning in terms of Price to Sales, because sales are more stable. From here you can derive the earnings yield, in other words the percentage of money you receive annually as an investor from the business, that\u2019s price dependent, for that reason the price you buy a stock is fundamental. Earnings Yield is the inverted P/E or 1/(P/E). In the case of a company like Facebook (FB), with a P/E of 30 at this moment, the earnings yield is",

If I can estimate a growth rate of 15% for the next 5 yrs then the result is 18.3% total yield. But be careful when it comes to forecast the future, be factual and conservative! Be sure about the stories that sustain your numbers, if you are unsure, be conservative and apply a wide margin of safety (ELI5: think about an elevator. It can carry 300kg, but the manufacturer will report a max carry of 250 kg in order to avoid accidents, you have a margin that protects you from errors. We are imperfect human beings trying to forecast the future, errors are unavoidable). Please note that EPS are presented as diluted EPS, that\u2019s because the company sometimes issues some financial instruments that can be converted under some circumstances as new stocks, when these circumstances occur there are going to be more shares outstanding and this causes a reduction in Earnings per unit of share. Sometimes companies pay their employees with stock options, that means employees have the option to obtain stock under some circumstance that could be understood as a form of wages. That is only an example of a form of dilutive practice. The last two things I want to highlight are assets write-down and goodwill.

Goodwill impairment, goodwill is the premium companies pay in order to buy an asset or make an acquisition, sometimes this premium is well deserved and sometimes not. A good practice, when we analyze a company, is to deepen the value of an acquisition and evaluate the skill of managers in making an acquisition. Too much write-down or impairments overtime can be a bad sign.

He believes that by consistently lowering prices, Amazon will create a virtuous cycle that will lead to more free cash flow and a more valuable company.

This money can be used to build the foundations of our society, such as firms, corporations, and business projects. The goal of investing is to improve the future of our society and the future of our wealth. There are two main ways to invest: passive investing and stock picking. Passive investing involves buying through a fund a piece of a sector, a country, or even the world, and participating in the wealth growing. An example is the S&P500, which had an annual compounded rate of return of 13.2% over the last 10 years. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are financial instruments that mimic the trend of various indexes. Stock picking involves analyzing the fundamental components of a business and investing in what these firms produce in the future. It is important to set a goal when investing, such as freedom or providing education for a child. Financial statements are the best tool for developing quantitative analysis.
