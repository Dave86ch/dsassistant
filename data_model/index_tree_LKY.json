He explains that he would meet his children every dinner, unless he had a function, and take them away on holidays at least once a year for two weeks. He also talks about visiting HDB estates in the evenings and taking his children with him when he played golf. Balji then talks about the importance of the Chinese New Year's Eve gathering of the clan and how it is important to meet and welcome new family members. He also talks about the role of the Prime Minister and how it is different from when he was in charge. He quotes Theodore Roosevelt, saying \"Talk softly, but carry a big stick.\" Balji then responds to Catherine Lim's articles, saying she is wrong and does not understand that what a man says he will do and hopes to achieve when he is in charge as PM, is not necessarily what he can do or can afford to do when he is the PM.",
